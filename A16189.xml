            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat great good and profit (gentle Reader) is procured unto all Seafaring men by Books of Seacardes / which heeretofore have bin made and compoſed by Lucas Iohnſon Waghenaer / Albert Hayen / William Barents and others / wherein they with moſt great diligence have written the ſituation of the Streames / Havens and Chanels of the Seas in divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys / it is impoſſible to declare / for that thereby not onely manie Ships and Merchants goods / but alſo manie Men have had their lives preſerved / which is ſo manifeſt and well knowne unto everie man / that it were altogether needeleſſe and in vaine to illuſtrate it by examples.</p>
            <p>It is alſo well knowne to everie Seafaring man / how much ſome Havens and Chanels in the Seas / are and have beene in proceſſe of time cleane altered and changed / ſpecially in theſe Countreys of Holland / Zealand and Freeſland / which alſo for the moſt part are ſo much altered / ſince then were deſcribed by the ſaid Authors / that ſome of them have now no likeneſſe nor ſimilitude thereof / ſome are allmoſt ſpoyled / and ſome wholly aboliſhed / and cleane ſtopt up: for the North Chanel / which by Waghenaer and Albert Hayen was deſcribed to be the beſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Vlie / at this preſent reacheth out cleane contrarie / and therewithall it is ſo much altered / that it can not be uſed but by ſmall ſhips. The North Elve / which by them is deſcribed to be a deepe and faire Chanel / is alſo cleane ſpoyled / but in ſteede thereof the South Elve is broken out againe with a faire deepe chanel. And the place where yet within theſe fewe yeeres the ſteeple of Huyſden did ſtand / lyeth now ſo farre into the Sea / that Ships full laden runne over it / both entring into / and comming out of the Texel: whereby ſuch deſcriptions at this time are not onely unfit / but verie hurtfull / if a man ſhould rule himſelf by them.</p>
            <p>This conſidered / I (according to my abilitie / for the good and benefit of Seafaring men) have taken the Books of the aforeſaid Authors in hand / to clenſe / correct and amende them of all their faults (beſides that which I have newely gotten and collected to adde unto them) as much as poſſible I can: wherein I have neither ſpared trouble / labour nor charges / that by the aide and furtherance of manie expert and ſkilfull Sailers / Pilots and Maſters (of whoſe ſtil and knowledge I was well aſſured) I might deſcribe and declare the ſame / in ſuch manner as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent worke / and the neceſſitie and worthines thereof requireth. Lucas Iohnſon Wagenaer himſelf (not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed) hath alſo by writing ſhewed manie notable faults / which in his Book were neceſſarily to be corrected and amended. As touching the Cardes / I have eſpecially much bettered them / with the reaching of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes verie neceſſarie to be uſed / and alſo enlarged them / and according to the examples of the beſt Cardes ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them / that therein you not onely ſee / how you may ſaile into / and come out of all Havens and Chanels / but alſo how farre they reach / and are in wideneſſe and length diſtant from each other: which never heeretofore (be it ſpoken without boaſting) was ſo perfectly and ſo beneficially done for the good of Seafaring men. I have alſo placed all the places of the Weſt Seas under their right heights: but touching the Eaſt Seas / I could not bring that to paſſe before this time / becauſe we wanted the true collection thereof / for that the ſame which Lucas Wage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naer
<pb facs="tcp:17769:4"/> writeth thereof / is falſe / and he contradicteth himſelf / which may partly be perceived by that which enſueth. He writeth / that the Sond lyeth under 56 degrees and 12 minutes / and Schagen under 57 degrees and 48 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes / whereby it ſhould followe / (for that the ſaid two places lye diſtant ſoutheaſt and northweſt) that they ſhould be diſtant one from the other 33 or 34 Dutch myles: whereas notwithſtanding he himſelf writeth / that they are but 25 myles diſtant from each other: but that both theſe poſitions are falſe / I prove it thus. The middle of the Ile of Ween lyeth juſt under 55 degrees and 54 minutes / and ſeeing that the Sond is but a myle and an half or two myles diſtant from thence / and rather weſterlyer then north / then of force the Sond can not lye higher / then under 56 degrees: and ſo / if wee (according to the common geſſing) reckon / from the Sond to Schagen 25 myles / then the Point of Schagen muſt lye under 57 degrees and 11 or 12 minutes / which differeth from Wagenaers poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion almoſt two third parts of a degree. Or if Schagen laye under ſuch a heigth as Wagenaer writeth / then Schagen and the Sond ſhould be diſtant from each other about 38 myles / which is not credible. Manie ſuch like / and (as I thinke) much greater faults ſhould be ſeene / if the certaine truth thereof could be found.</p>
            <p>Beſides this / I have heereunto added a Brief Inſtitution touching the Arte of Navigation: wherein is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed / what knowledge of Aſtronomie is neceſſarie for a Seafaring man: wherein hitherto there hath beene much abuſe committed among them. But unneceſſarie things / wherewith ſome Seafaring men trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in vaine / I have omitted and wholly left out: as / what the Eccentricities / Augeas and Apogeas / the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude / Latitude / and the Paralaxes of the Planets are: all which things (as alſo manie other Aſtronomicall high Speculations) have no uſe in Seafaring / nor can by anie meanes further a Seafaring man.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe omitted and forborne to write anie thing of the Lengths / which men commonly call / the Eaſt and Weſt / whereof ſome men boaſt and vaunt themſelves / to have found great matters / and that a man may finde the waie from Eaſt to Weſt ſo perfectly / as from South to North: but all that which hitherto / touching that matter is come to light / is not onely unprofitable / but alſo (if a man ſhould truſt thereunto) both hurtfull and deceitfull: whereof in the fourth part of this Book I thinke to write more at large / as alſo / what good and benefit a Pilot may have by the Direction of the Needle / or altering of the Compas / whereupon theſe newe found Lengths are built / although without ground or true foundation.</p>

Right in the middle between both the Poles we ſuppoſe a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be placed, which we call the Equinoctiall Line, or the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, and is ſo called for that whenſoever the Sonne cometh to this circle, the day and night is of one length throughout all the World. This circle is in all places equally diſtant from both the Poles of the World, to wit 90 degrees, &amp; devideth the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens in two equal partes, whereof the one reacheth northward, and is called the North-part, the other ſouthward, and is called the South-part, as it is plainly ſeen in the foreſaid Globe or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, where you ſee the circle E C the Equinoctiall Line, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding juſt of one length from the Poles B D, deviding the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens into two equall partes, as the North-part E B C, and the South-part E D C.</p>

               <p>THree and twentie degrees 31 ½ minutes northward from the Equinoctiall Line there is a circle ſuppoſed to be, which is called <hi>Tropicus Cancri,</hi> or the courſe of the Sonne in Cancer: for that when the Sonne cometh by courſe unto that circle, he beginneth to turne again towards the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall.

                  </gap>ctiall Line, there is another circle ſuppoſed to be, which is called <hi>Tropicus Capricorni,</hi> or the courſe of the Sonne in Capricornus, for that when the Sonne in winter tyme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to this circle, he beginneth again to turne unto the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall. Theſe two circles goe round about the Heavens, and are equally diſtant from the Equinoctiall. But how &amp; in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner toucheth the Sonne in his courſe (once in Sommer &amp; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyme in Winter) thoſe two circles? It happeneth thus: we ſuppoſe a great circle to be in the Heavens wherein the Sonne holdeth his courſe, which lyeth thwart-wiſe over the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall, that is, the one half northward, the other half ſouthward, in ſuch manner, that in the place where he goeth moſt north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the Equinoctiall Line, there he entreth into <hi>Tropicus Cancri,</hi> and where he goeth moſt ſouthward from the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall Line, there he entreth into <hi>Tropicus Capricorni.</hi> The two pointes or places where he goeth or cutteth over the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall, ſtand right over againſt each other, ſo that both the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall and theſe two circles are devided into two equall parts, which pointes are called the one, the Equinoictall in Lent, and the other the Equinoctiall in Harveſt, which by the Figure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeweing more playnely appeareth.</p>

This Circle aforeſayd is devided into 12 even partes, each part having a proper ſigne belonging unto it, &amp; everie ſigne hath 30 degrees, ſo that the whole Circle (as all other Circles doe) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth 360 degrees.

               <p>IN this Zodiack or Ecliptick Line aforſayd, the middle point of the Sonne hath his courſe, without once going out of it, paſſing through it everie yeare once, that is everie moneth through one ſigne, and everie day almoſt a degree. Upon the 20 of March <hi>ſtilo novo,</hi> and the 10 of March <hi>ſtilo vechio,</hi> when the dayes &amp; nights are juſt of one length throughout al the World, then the Sonne entreth into the Equinoctiall, that is to ſay, into <hi>Aries,</hi> the 20 or 10 of April he entreth into <hi>Taurus,</hi> the 20 or 10 of May into <hi>Gemini,</hi> the 21 or 11 of Iune into <hi>Cancer,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Tropicus Cancri,</hi> and then he is at the fartheſt of his courſe northward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Equinoctiall, then all thoſe that dwell north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the Line have their longeſt day, and thoſe that dwell ſouthward from the Line their shorteſt day. The So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne holding his courſe, then beginneth to turne again to the Line, and the 23 or 13 of Iulie entreth into <hi>Leo,</hi> the 23 or 13 of Auguſt into <hi>Virgo,</hi> and the 23 or 13 of September he commeth again on the Line, in the beginning of <hi>Libra,</hi> makeing the dayes and nights one again of one length throughout all the World, the 23 or 13 of October he entereth into <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the 22 or 12 of November into <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> and the 22 or 12 of December to <hi>Tropicus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorni,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Capricornus,</hi> then are the dayes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt with them that dwell ſouthward from the Line. The 20 or 10 of Ianuarie, the Sonne commeth further, and entreth into <hi>Aquarius,</hi> about the 18 or 8 of Februarie into <hi>Piſces,</hi> and the 20 or 10 of March he entreth again into <hi>Aries.</hi> This ought alſo to be known and marked: that this Zodiack ſtandeth unmoveably with the fixed Starres, with the which everie day he is caried about from Eaſt to Weſt, without alteration: and that the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne doth the foreſayd yearely courſe contrariwiſe, from weſt to eaſt, whereby in his dayly courſe he is ſo much hindred, that in the yeare he goeth one time leſſe about then the fixed Starres.</p>

And this Declination is twofold, Northward and Southward: for when the Sonne is on the north part of the Line, then his declination is Northward, and when it is on the ſouthpart of the Line then his declination is Southward.</p>

               <p>TO knowe the declination of the Sonne perfectly everie day in the yeere, in former tymes there were tables made which ſerved for foure yeeres, but they were gathered out of old and corrupt obſervations, ſo that at ſome tymes of the yeere they differed almoſt a fourth part of a degree from the truth, as it appeareth by the true calculation thereof made by the Learned Aſtronomer <hi>Tycho Brahae.</hi> And therefore for
<pb facs="tcp:17769:6"/> the good of all Seafaring men, not without much labour &amp; dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence I have collected a new book of degrees for foure yeares out of the aforeſayd <hi>Tycho Brahae</hi> breſt corrected notes, juſt for the Meridian (that is) after the longitude of the Low-countries, which Tables of declinations may ſerve without any weightie alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (or that can be any hinderance unto Seafaring men) for the ſpace of 20 yeres. Now to know how much the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day of the yeare declineth from the Equinoctiall, firſt ſee in what yeare and moneth you are, and what day of the moneth it is, the ſame day ſeek in the firſt columne, and there againſt it in the ſecond columne you shall finde how many degrees and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes the Sonne is gone or declined from the Equator: but to know whether it be northward or ſouthward, you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 10 of March to the 13 of September it goeth on the northſide from the Line, and from the 13 of September again to the 10 of March ſouthward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Line. But to know whether it is a Leap-yeare, or the firſt, ſecond, or third year from it, we have to that end placed a ſmall Table under this Chapter, wherein without any labour you may finde it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the fixed Starres, their declination, and how they may alter in the declination, withall shewing how men may eaſily learne to know them.</head>
               <p>THe Declination of the Starres is almoſt like unto that of the Sonne, and is twofold, that is Northward &amp; South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: thoſe that ſtand Northward from the Equinoct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all decline northward, and thoſe that ſtand Southward from the Equinoctiall decline ſouthward. But this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the declination of the Sonne and of the ſtarres, the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sonne altereth, and is increaſed or shortned everie day, and the one half yeere declineth northward, and the other half yeere ſouthward: but the declination of the fixed ſtarres is otherwiſe, for ſome of them that decline northward or ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, are alwayes on the north or ſouth ſide of the Line: &amp; ſome of them that decline northward, may decline ſouthward, and ſome that decline ſouthward may alſo decline northward: but that is verie long and in a great ſpace of tyme, though ſome of them do it with more ſpeed, and in shorter tyme then the reſt; according to their ſituations in the Heavens. Some of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe a minute everie three yeeres, ſo that everie ten or twelve yeeres they need correction, and ſome cannot alter a minute of their declination in 40 or 50 yeeres, as may be proved by good reaſon drawne from the naturall courſe and moving of the fixed ſtarres. The brighteſt, and cheifeſt; and moſt fitte to be uſed at Sea, we have hereafter placed, with their right decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation accordig to the yeere 1608, as they by the aforeſayd <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Brahae</hi> are found and obſerved to be ſituated. How great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie &amp; profit it is for a Sea-faring man to have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the fixed Starres and their ordinarie courſe, ſpecially in ſtrange and long voyages, is well knowne unto all expert and skilfull Pilots. And for that in theſe dayes there are yet manie Sea-faring men, that have no knowledge of the fixed Starres, we will hereafter together with their declination, showe alſo an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and convenient way, readily to learne to knowe them, and at all tymes perfectly to knowe when each of them enter into the ſouth or are at the higheſt, and are fitte to be uſed. In the fourth chapter it is shewed, that the fixed Starres, goe once a yeere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Heavens more then the Sonne, ſo that everie day they come about 4 min. further ſouthward, which is everie weeke, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an howre, and everie moneth two howres, which that it may the better be underſtood, we will make it evident by an example taken from the Starre called <hi>Syrius,</hi>

And if you deſire to knowe the like touching all the reſt of the fixed Starres upon everie day in the yeere, then marke what was ſayd before, upon what howre of the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet downe, the great Dogge commeth into the ſouth, and then by the tables hereafter following touching the declination of the Starres, marke how long tyme the Starre you ſeeke for cometh into the ſouth before or after the great Dogge, and by that meanes you shall finde the juſt and perfect tyme that you deſire.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> How to finde the houres of the night at all tymes of the Yeere.</head>
               <p>IN the Chapter before it is shewed, how a man at all tymes of the yeere shall perfectly know at what houre the Starres, (as wel by day as by night) come into the ſouth or the north Now it is neceſſarie with all to knowe, how a man by night shal knowe and finde out what houre it is. Whereunto ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument as hereafter is ſet downe is verie requiſite, whereof you may make the like, or els you may prepare this for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in manner hereafter following: the undermoſt and greateſt Rondel and peece whereon the twelve moneths are marked, you muſt cleave upon a plaine round bord, ſo that (as in this Figure) the firſt of September be ſet right under, and the 27 of Februarie right over, and right in the center or middle, make a round hole, wherin you may put a reaſonable wodden pinne or coper nayle, which within muſt be hollowe like a pipe. The other Peece whereon the houres are marked you muſt cleave upon another board, or peece of paſtboard, and in the middle thereof alſo make another hole, which may goe over the nayle, &amp; winde about it. Laſtly make a Ruler of woode or coper (as the figure sheweth you) with a hole alſo, that it may winde about the hollow nayle, but you muſt looke that the one end of the Rule doth reach or ſtand right upon the middle of the hole of the hollowe nayle, that is, upon the center of the whole Inſtrument. The Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being thus prepared, if you deſire to knowe what houre it is of the night by the Starres, then ſet the tooth that pointeth out the twelfth houre in the moveable Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>del where the houres ſtand, right upon the day of the yeere whereof you deſire to knowe the houre, &amp; hold it faſt ſtanding in that ſorte: after that lift the whole Inſtrument uppe on high &amp; bowe the uppermoſt part thereof ſo much towards you, untill you may ſee the north Starre through the hollowe naile: but you muſt underſtand that the Inſtrument muſt be holden ſo, that the nether end of the foot thereof marked A B may ſtand like a water-compas. Now when you ſee the North-ſtarre through the hole, then winde the Rule ſo long about untill that on the right ſide of the Rule, you may ſee the hinder wheeles of the great Wagon; which donne, then the Rule will point unto the houre upon the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rondell what tyme of the night it is. But if it chanceth, that by any lett or hinderance you cannot ſee the great Wagon, then in ſteed thereof take the middlemoſt and lighteſt of the Watchers, and do in all pointes as aforeſayd: but then you muſt knowe that it will be foure houres and 15 minutes later then the Rule will shew it, by reaſon that the aforeſayd wheeles of the Wagon goe ſo much before the Watchers.</p>

               <p>THe Meridian is a circle in the Heavens, which wee muſt conceive to paſſe through both the Poles of the World, right over our heads, and croſſe-wiſe through the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, and to cutte through the Horizon right north &amp; ſouth. The Sonne touching this circle is at the higheſt: and then it is juſt noone, or the middle time of the day, &amp; likewiſe the Starres when they come upon this Circle, they are (like the Sonne) at the higheſt of the Horizon, and right ſouth, and as ſoone as they have paſt it they begin to go downward againe.</p>

               <p>THe Heigth of the Snne or Starres is nothing els but the diſtance or ſpace, that is betweene the Horizon and the Sonne or Starr it ſelf: which to underſtand perfectly, you muſt marke, that we ſuppoſe a point or prick to be right above our heads in the Heavens, that is equally diſtant from the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon in all places, which point is called the <hi>Zenith,</hi> or the Head-point: Now ſeeing that the whole circuite of the Heavens conteyneth 360 degrees, and that the juſt half thereof is ſeene above the Horizon, it is certaine that this point called the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith</hi> in all places is above the Horizon 90 degrees, whether you turne Eaſt, Weſt, North, or South, or any other way: now when the Sonne riſeth above the Horiſon, and aſcendeth higher and higher from it, and commeth toward this point or <hi>Zenith,</hi> wee ſay that as many degrees as it is aſcended, from the Horizon, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the aforeſaid point or Zenith, that the ſame is the height thereof, as by example, when he is riſen half up from the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon towards the Zenith, then he is 45 degrees high, and if he be riſen a third part from the Horizon then he is 30 degrees high, and ſo forth, the like is alſo to be underſtood of the height of the Starres.</p>

               <p>TO finde the height, the Mathematicians have deviſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers fitte Inſtruments, wherof there are two that are moſt to be uſed at Sea, which are the Aſtrolabium, &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Croſſe-ſtaffe, the uſe of the Aſtrolabium is plaine and well knowne unto all men, for holding the Inſtrument by the ring let the Sonne ſhine through the holes of the eares, then the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt part of the Dyall (counting from belowe upwards) ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth how many degrees the Sonne is riſen above the Horizon: as the former figure plainely ſhoweth.</p>
               <p>The Croſſe-ſtaffe is uſed thus, you muſt place the end of the Staffe underneath the eye, then you muſt remove the Croſſe to and fro, untill the upper end of the Croſſe ſtandeth even upon half the Sonne or Starre, and the under end juſt with the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and then the Croſſe will ſhewe you upon the Staffe how many degrees there are betweene the Horizon and the Sonne or Starre, that is, how many degrees they are in heigth, ſo you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count after thoſe numbers whereof 90 ſtandeth at the end of the Staffe that is next to your eye, the computation going backward from the other end of the Staffe: for otherwiſe if you reckon by thoſe numbers that proceed forward from the end next your eye, then it will ſhowe you how many degrees, the Sone or Starre ſtandeth from the Zenith, or Head-point to the Horizon, as you may ſee by the figure enſeuing.</p>

               <p>Make an even ſmoth borde, and paſt good paper upon it, then darwe a ſtraight line upon one edge or ſide thereof, as you ſee in this figure a line marked C A D, then make another line as you ſe it marcked B C, that B C A be a right &amp; juſt half ſquare, then take a good pare of Compaſſes, and ſet one foot thereof in the Angle marked C, and compaſſe therewith as you ſee B E A, ſo that A E B may be a right quadrant, or fourth-part of a circle, then devide it into two partes, to E, and then devide the other half (which is A E) into 90 partes, or degrees as thus: firſt devide it into three partes, and then devide each third-part againe into three, &amp; then it will be devided into 9 partes, which donne, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide each of them into two partes, and thoſe Deviſions or partes devide into five partes, and then it wil be devided into 90 partes. then take a ſtraight line, and lay the one end thereof upon the Center C, &amp; ſo forth upon everie ſeverall point, which you have devided in the Quadrant, and then drawe lines from the Center C through al the aforeſaid pointes, as long as the bord will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them, as you may ſee in this figure: which do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne then your Inſtrument is fully made &amp; prepared to marke your Staves ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Which to doe, with your Compaſſes take juſt the half length of your Croſſe, and ſett the one foot thereof in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter C &amp; put the other at F, and doe the like from D right to G, which two pointes or prickes drawe with a ſtraight line unto each other as you ſee the line F and G, and then marke where the line F G is cut through by the lines that come out of the Center through the degrees or pointes of the quadrant: for thoſe cuttinges through, shew upon the ſaid line the right mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of your Croſſe-ſtaffe: that is, you muſt marke your Staffe juſt as you ſee that theſe lines in F G are marked, by the lines that come out of the Center and paſſe through it, whether the Croſſe be long or short, you muſt followe the ſame order that you be taught, as in the Figure the line H I is drawne for a shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Croſſe then the former, and K L for one that is shorter then that, viz. whoſe half is juſt as long as the line C K.</p>
               <p>The ſecond manner of framing your Croſſe-ſtaffe much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth the firſt in perfectnes and curioſitie, ſo you devide it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly with your Compaſſe, which is donne in this manner. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an hard eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> board which is paſted with paper draw a ſtraight line, as long as your Staffe is, and with your Compaſſe take the juſt half of the length of your Croſſe, whereunto you meane to marke your Staffe, and prick it as many tymes along in the ſayd
<pb facs="tcp:17769:16"/> line as you can: and devide each of the ſayd lengthes into tenne-thouſand equale partes, then look upon the table hereafter enſeuing, which ſhewe you, how many of thoſe pointes or parts you ſhall marke for each degree, and that you muſt doe in manner following: from the end of the Staffe, which you will make the eye-end, prick juſt the half length of the Croſſe, and there make a croſſe ſtroake, from whence prick for everie degree ſo many of the aforeſaid partes as the table enſeuing ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you. As for example, for the firſt degree prick 178 partes, for the ſecond 355 partes, for the third 538 partes, for the fourth 724 partes, and ſo forth: Remembring that you muſt prick all the lengths of prickes or partes aforeſayd, from the aforeſaid Croſſe ſtroke, which is marked upon the half length of the Croſſe: but if you can not devide the half length of the Croſſe into tenne-thou-ſand partes, then devide the whole Croſſe ſo, and then take for everie degree half ſo manye as the table ſheweth unto you: and if you can not doe ſo, devide half the Croſſe into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand partes, and then leave the two hinder letters of the table out, as where you ſhould for the firſt degree take an hundred-ſeventie-and-eight partes, take but 17 partes, leaving the laſt figure out: but if your Croſſes be ſo ſmale that you can devide the half of them into no ſmaller then an hundred partes, then leave out the two laſt figures in the table. But you muſt underſtand that the more partes that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Croſſes into, your markes will fall out ſo much the better and perfecter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIIII.</hi> Of the cutting of the Croſſe-ſtaffe and how a man may help and prevent all the defects of the ſtaffe.</head>
               <p>THere being a Croſſe-ſtaffe well and exquiſitely framed, according to the doctrine of the former chapter: it falleth out that certayne ignorant perſons cutt off a peece from the eye-end of the Staffe, about a degree, or a degree &amp; an half, or two degrees long, and can give no other reaſon of that their doing but that it muſt be ſo, and that they have experience that it ought ſo to be. But queſtionleſſe ſeeing they prove by their experience that they do not finde their meaſuring with uncutt Staves perfect and right as it ſhould be, the fault thereof is not in the Croſſe-ſtaves uncutt, but in themſelves, for that they knowe not how to uſe the Staffe aright, nor underſtand not the true ground thereof. Others that will ſeeme wiſer then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, give a reaſon thereof: to wit, that the Staffe muſt be cutte, becauſe of the hollownes of the eye, for that otherwiſe the Staff cannot come to ſtand ſo that the end thereof be conjoyned to the middle point or center of the eye or ſight: this reaſon hath ſome ſhowe of truth, but notwithſtanding is alike untrue &amp; er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneus: for the Staffe may verie well be ſett, either on the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt or outtermoſt corner of the eye, ſo that the ſight of the eye may fall to anſwer juſt to the end of the Staffe: that this is truth we will prove with good reaſon as followeth.</p>
               <p>Sette the great Croſſe with the middlemoſt upon like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: to witte each upon ſuch as for that purpoſe are marked upon the Staffe: then applie the Staffe (the Croſſes ſo firmely remayning) unto your eye in ſuch manner, (whether it be on the innermoſt or uttermoſt corner it is all one) as that you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne the endes of the Croſſes both above &amp; beneath juſt over each other, in forme as this figure ſpecifieth. If then you drawe ſtraight lines by the endes of the Croſſes A B and D C they ſhall meete juſt in the middle point of your ſight. And inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Croſſes are placed upon like degrees, the lines afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſhall meet juſt upon the end of the Staffe; ſeeing that that end of the Staffe repreſenteth the center of the quadrant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by your ſtaffe is marked.</p>
               <figure>
                  <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
               </figure>
               <p>So then the foreſaid lines or endes of the Croſſes anſwer both juſt upon the ende of the Staffe, and alſo upon the ſight: ſo that it followeth neceſſarily and appeareth evidently, that the ende of the Staffe &amp; the ſight meet in one: or to ſpeak properly, both of them ſtand juſt in the center of the quadrant.</p>
               <p>Therefore whenſoever with the Croſſe-ſtaffe you wil take the height of the Sonne or of any Starre, then obſerve diligently: how many degrees it is elevated above the Horizon: and place the two Croſſes upon ſo many degrees: then applie the Staffe to your eye in ſuch manner as that you may ſee the endes of the Croſſes juſt over each other, according as is taught before: in ſuch forme then as you finde the Staffe to ſtand to your eye, ſhall you place the Staffe (taking away one of the Croſſes) when you deſire to meaſure according to ſuch height: this is a ſure rule which will never faile, neither can you poſſibly miſſe if you follow it.</p>

               <p>THe breadth of Landes or Countries is no other, then the diſtance or widenes that is betweene the ſaid Landes and the Equinoctiall Line, which is reckoned in a double
<pb facs="tcp:17769:17"/> manner, that is northerly and ſoutherly, to the number of 90. Such Lands or Countries as lye right under the Equinoctiall Line have no breadth: but ſuch as lye northward from it, have northerly breadth, and they that lye ſoutherly, have ſoutherly breadth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Iland of <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> in the River <hi>Gaban</hi> in Guinea lyeth right under the Line, and therefore hath no breadth, neither nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly nor ſoutherly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cap S. Vincent</hi> in Spaine lyeth northward from the Line 37 degrees, and therefore the northern breadth of <hi>Cap S. Vincent</hi> is 37 degrees.</p>
               <p>The point of <hi>Lezaret</hi> in England lyeth northward from the Line 50 degrees, therefore the north breadth of <hi>Lezaret</hi> is 50 degrees.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cap de bona Eſperance</hi> lyeth ſouthward from the Line 34½ degrees, therefore the ſoutherly breadth of <hi>Cap de bona Eſperance</hi> is 34 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe height and breadth of Landes &amp; Countries although that in them ſelves they are divers thinges, yet they are alwaies one like unto the other: Any Countrie being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated under the breadth of 30 degrees, lyeth alſo in the heigth 30 degrees, which by Sea-faring men is taken without difference, but what it is, or what it hath in it or ſignifieth fewe men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and yet it behoveth a Sea-faring man, that ſeeketh for the height of any Countries, to be expert therein, for that no man without it can well underſtand how any Inſtrument (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Aſtralabium, or Croſſe-ſtaffe, no nor the Sea-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it ſelf) ſhould wel be uſed: for that theſe things are al built upon one foundation, &amp; like a chaine hang one upon the other. But it may be that ſome man will object and ſay, that there are many Pilots which do not well underſtand ſuch things, and yet are able to goe directly unto divers places, whither they deſire to ſayle: which I confeſſe to be true: but tell me, how many times are they deceived? how manie times are they in great doubt and fear? and how ſeldome dare they truſt unto the height which they have taken or reckoned, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are to ſeek out any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie there by? how often tymes hath it heretofore happened, that for want of ſuch knowledge, ſhips have ſayled out of their way either behinde England or upon France, which thought to paſſe through the chanell between England and France, and that in ſo ſhort and well knowne, and common ſayled water, as to come out of Spaine or France? what would ſuch men doe, if they ſhould paſſe the Line, and were to ſeeke or finde out certaine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands? or that after they had ſayled up and downe the Seaes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine moneths together, ſhould then ſeek out for Lande? but I am of this opinion which I knowe everie man will grant, that it is much better and more aſſured to goe a way being guided by his owne eye-ſight, then like a blinde man to be led by another, and knoweth not whether that other ſeeth well or not: but to come againe to our matter, touching the height of Countries, it is no other but the height of the Pole above the Horizon, that is to ſay, ſo many degrees as the Pole in any Land is lifted up above the Horizo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo much is the height of ſuch a Countrie: and this height agreeth alwaies with the breadth as aforeſaid. In the 10 chapter it is ſhewed, that whereſoever a man goeth or turneth, alwaies the one half of the Heavens ſheweth it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon and the other half is hidden from us: in the firſt Chapter it is ſaid that the two Poles ſtand right one againſt the other, whereby it is evidently to be underſtood, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man being upon the earth is right under the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Line, that then both the Poles of the World, lye right in the Horizon, one in the ſouth and the other in the north: &amp; as much as a man travaileth northward from the Equinoctiall Line, and winneth breadth northerly, ſo much the north Pole riſeth above the Horizon: and the ſouth Pole contrarie wiſe goeth ſo much under: &amp; on the contrarie, as many degrees as a man goeth from the Equinoctiall Line ſouthward, and winneth breadth ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo much the ſouth Pole riſeth above the Horizon, and the north Pole goeth ſo much under: which may eaſily be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Figure hereafter following.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17769:18"/>

               </figure>
               <p>In this figure the undermoſt rondel that turneth about, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Heavens, N the north pole, S the ſouth Pole, AE the Equinoctiall, the uppermoſt edge of the half moveable rundle, ſignifieth the Horizon, the one half of the Heavens is above it, and the other half juſt under it, the round bale in the middle ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth the Earth, whereon you ſee a litle man, that may be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Earth ſouthward and northward.</p>
               <p>Now perfectly to marke and perceive that which is before written, that is to knowe what heigth is, &amp; that it alwaies agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the breadth, bring the litle man upon the Earth-globe right under the Equinoctiall, that is to ſay, that it have no breadth, neither northward nor ſouthward, then you ſhal ſee that both the Poles lye juſt with the Horizon, &amp; that neither of them both are elevated above it, nor depreſſed under it: and with all you ſhall ſee that they that dwell under the Equinoctial have no heigth or elevation of the Pole, nor yet any breadth. But if you remove the man ſo much northward that he goeth tenne degrees upon the Earth, that is, that he commeth tenne degrees upon the north beadth, you ſhall ſee that the north-Pole ſhall be raiſed or elevated tenne degrees above the Horizon in the north, and the ſouth Pole ſhall goe tenne degrees under the Horizon: and if you remove the man upon the Earth more northerly, as thirtie, fortie, or fiftie degrees, the north Pole will alſo be ſo much elevated, and the ſouth Pole to the contrarie ſo much depreſſed under the Horizon: ſo that if you turne the man upon the Earth to ninetie degrees, then the north Pole alſo will be elevated ninetie degrees, that is the Pole wil ſtand right above his head, and the Equinoctiall will joyne with the Horizon in one circle: that which thus is ſaid of the Elevating of the north Pole, is alſo in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be underſtood of the ſouth Pole: for if like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you move the man upon the Earth in the figure toward the ſouth, the ſouth Pole will be elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon, as much as the man in breadth goeth ſouthward, and the north Pole will goe ſo much under the Horizon.</p>
               <p>One thing is herein to be noted, that as much as the Pole ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth above the Horizon juſt ſo much the Equinoctiall goeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and when the Pole goe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h under the Equinoctiall riſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in equall proportion.</p>
               <p>But above all you muſt marke, that the number of the Poles elevation added to the heigth of the Equinoctiall alwayes make even 90 degrees; ſo that when the Pole is elevated thirtie degrees in the north, the Equinoctiall is elevated ſixtie degrees in the ſouth: but if the ſouth Pole be elevated above your Horizon
<pb facs="tcp:17769:18"/> twentie degrees, the Equinoctiall will be elevated in the north ſeventie degrees, which is clearly underſtood and ſhewed in this manner: we alwaies ſee half the heavens above the Horizon, (as aforeſaid) which is twice ninetie degrees, from the ſouth to the Zenith or the point juſt over our heads, and from the Zenith to the Horizon in the north. Now ſeeing that betweene the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall and the Pole there are alwaies ninetie degrees, (as is ſhewed in the ſecond Chapter) it followeth that that which is beneath the Pole and the Equinoctiall, maketh alſo ninetie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: therefore when we knowe the heigth of the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and take it out of ninetie, that which reſteth over is alwaies the heigth of the Pole. This alſo may be ſeene in the figure aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>TO finde the heigth of the Pole by the Sonne, one thing is ſpecially to be marked, to wit, whether you are north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or ſouthward from the Sonne, whether the Sonne ſtandeth northward or ſouthward from you is eaſily knowne, when you are in ſuch a place upon the Earth as is farre from the Line, or from the Sonne, but when the Sonne is neere almoſt above your head, then you can not well ſee it with your eye, therefore ſet a compaſſe before you, that you may ſee where north and ſouth is, then take your Aſtrolabium, and ſet it ſo that the one edge thereof ſtand right ſouth, and the other north, and then you ſhall ſee at a haires breadth, whether the Sonne being at the heigth, ſtandeth northward or ſouthward from the head-point or Zenith: if then you will ſeeke the heigth of the Pole, when you are on the north ſide of the Sonne, that is when the Sonn is ſouthward from you, then take the juſt heigth firſt, and as much as the declination of the Sonne is northward, take it out of your heigth &amp; that which reſteth is the heigth of the Equinoctiall in the ſouth,<note place="margin">With nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</note> which ſubtracted out of ninetie, (as in the former Chapter is declared) then you have the heigth of the north Pole.</p>

               <p>In this figure let P be the north Pole, and G the ſouth Pole, E H the Equinoctiall, A B the Horizon, Z the Zenith, and D the Sonne: let the heigth of the Sonne B D be ſixtie degrees above the Horizon: the northerly declination D E eight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: if then you take D E eight degrees fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> B D the heigth of the Sonne, there will reſt B E two-and fiftie degrees, which is the heigth of the Equinoctiall, which taken out of ninetie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, reſteth eight-and-thirtie degrees, for the heigth of the north Pole A P, as in the ſixteenth Chapter is ſhewed.</p>
               <p>If the declination be ſoutherly, then adde it to the heigth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid taken: and then if the addition be leſſe then ninetie,<note place="margin">With ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</note> then looke upon the heigth of the Line in the ſouth which taken out of 90, as aforſaid, it leaveth you the heigth of the north Pole.</p>

               <p>But if the height of the Sonne being added unto the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, maketh more then 90 degrees, then you muſt underſtand, that the Equinoctiall is northward from your head juſt ſo much as the aforeſaid addition is more then 90 &amp; ſo conſequently the ſouth Pole alſo ſhall be ſo much elevated.</p>

                  <head>How you must uſe the North ſtarre, when you take the Watchers upon the four chief ſtrokes in the Compaſſe.</head>
                  <p>AL Seafaring men commonly uſe the north Starre when they take the Watchers upon one of the eight-quarter ſtrokes of the Compaſſe, whereunto they have certaine tables to knowe how much the north Starre ſtandeth upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſtroke of the compaſſe either under or above the Pole, that is how many they ſhall adde or ſubtract to or from each Starre. In moſt part or the bookes made for Seafaring it is ſhewed, that when the Watchers ſtand in the eaſt, that then the North Starre ſtandeth beneath the Pole a degree and an half, ſome ſay a degree and 40 minutes: and again when the Watchers ſtand in the weſt, that then the North Starre ſtandeth as much (that is a degree &amp; an half) above the Pole. Now if Eaſt and Weſt were uſed and underſtood by Seafaring men; when the middlemoſt Watcher is juſt Eaſt and Weſt with the North-ſtarre, &amp; that generally in all heights &amp; places without any difference, certainely they ſhould be much deceived by ſuch rule and cuſtome, for ſuch working is not generall, but in each height ſeverall, and ſo working in that manner they muſt uſe ſeverall tables. The North-ſtarre is alwaies more under the Pole when the Watchers ſtand in the eaſt, then he is above the Pole when the Watchers ſtand in the weſt, as in the table following you may ſee, being about the Equinoctiall it ſhould not differ much, but there a man can not uſe it: but as ſoone as you ſayle northward, &amp; leave the Equinoctial Line, then it beginneth to alter, and the more northerly that you goe, the more it differeth, ſo that at laſt, before you come to the height of 80 degrees, and that the Watchers come to ſtand in the weſt, the North Starre is a great deale under the Pole, how much this may differ upon one ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke, it may be reckoned by this example. When you are under the height of 20 degrees, and that the Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſtand in the weſt, that is when the middlemoſt Watcher in the weſt, ſtandeth juſt as high above the Horizon as the North-ſtarre, then the North-ſtarre ſhal ſtand above the Pole one degree and two minutes: but comeing under the height of 80 degrees, and that the middlemoſt Watcher ſtandeth in the weſt juſt as high as the North-ſtarre, then the North-ſtarre ſhall ſtand 35 minutes beneath the Pole, which with the former differeth verie neare two whole degrees, &amp; that upon one ſtroke. And although two ſuch places are farre diſtant one from the other, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hereby it may eaſily be perceived and underſtood by men of judgment that this alteration, as you ſayle from the one place unto the other, by litle &amp; litle encreaſeth. Many men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in note a great difference, becauſe thereby they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not geſſe right, and yet can not underſtand what the cauſe therof is, ſo that ſome of them to mend it cutt off a peece of their Croſſe-ſtaffe, others make themſelves tables according to their owne fantaſies, one thus much, the other ſo much, yet without any ground or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſo that in their need, they dare not truſt to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r owne doings. Others for this cauſe wholly reject the North-ſtarre,
<pb facs="tcp:17769:22"/> eſteeming it altogether unfit to take the height by: but that is done for want of underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, for having good tables to that purpoſe it is as fit for uſe as any other ſtarr, &amp; to the end that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould uſe it with good ſecuritie, without any fault, I have (for the good of al ſeafaring men) to that end collected, &amp; (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great labour) perfectly made a new table, wherein men may truly ſee, how without any fault they may uſe the North-ſtar by the 4 chief points of the Compaſſe, that is, South, North, Eaſt &amp; Weſt, the reſt of the points or ſtrokes, to wete, northweſt, ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, ſouthweſt, and northeaſt, I leave out wittingly and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for a man can not place any certaine marke, whereby they may make a juſt geſſe, whenſoever the watchers ſtand upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe ſtrokes, ſo that for that cauſe they are ſubject to more falſhood, and therefore it is thought good that men ſhould not uſe them.</p>

               <p>THeſe aforeſaid rules although that they are ſo neceſſarie &amp; needefull for a Pilote to know, that without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them he can be no good Pilot, to goe anie long voyage, yet are they not ſufficient to make a good Pilot, that is al are not good Pilots that underſtand them well. For firſt a good Pilot muſt beſides them be expert at Sea, as the principall thing, which no man can learne by any ſpeculation, but by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and dealing in tyme he ſhall obteine it, wherby he ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:17769:23"/> know perfectly to diſpoſe al things that occurre in the art of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation. It is moſt neceſſarie and convenient for him to knowe the Landes, and how they lye to Sea-ward, how f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rre, and upon what ſtrokes of the compaſſe, the Pointes, Havens, and Rivers, are diſtant one from the other, and ſpecially he muſt be perfect in reckoning his Tydes, that he may knowe everie where what Moone maketh an high water in that place, that when he would enter into any Haven or place, where he can not get in at a lowe water, then he may ſtay till it be half flood, or till it be high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as tyme ſerveth, that he may ſayle in, and ſave both ſhip and goods. It is alſo verie neceſſarie for him to knowe how the Ebbes and Floods fall out, whether it be along by, or againſt the Land, thereby to know when the winde is ſtrong, whether he may lye in the ſtreame, or goe againſt the ſtreame, thereby to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will be any hinderance or furtherance unto him, whereon manie tymes there conſiſteth much. And alſo when a man is in the winde, whether it be in the North-ſea under England, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Flanders, or in the Chanel of the ſea, under England, that he ſhould knowe how to ſet his tydes and courſe, that he might ſtoppe his tides. All theſe things old experienced Pilots, ought willingly to ſhewe and learne young men that are deſirous and zealous to learne the art of Seafaring, and not to hide any ſuch thing from them, as ſome men doe without reaſon, who goe out of the waie with their Inſtruments, as Croſſe-ſtaves, Aſtrolabium and Compaſſes, and will not ſuffer the common ſaylers to ſee their work. This by ſome is done upon pride and unwillingnes, becauſe they would keepe the art &amp; knowledge onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by ſome becauſe they underſtand not their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings wel, &amp; therfore are in feare to be ſhamed, but let not young Seafaring men, and ſuch as are deſirous to knowe the art &amp; cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Seafaring, for that cauſe leave off their ſtudie therein, &amp; to that end when you ſayle out of any river or haven, you muſt reckon everie courſe along the reach from tonne to tonne, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beacon to beacon, which you muſt keepe well and perfectly and write it in a booke, and ſome times drawe the ſituation in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Carde, and when you begin to leave the Land, then you muſt take good heede, of the Capes, Points, Towres, and other markes, and how the mouth of the Haven reacheth into the Sea, what deapth is at the enterance of the Haven, and how deepe it is both within and without, caſt out your lead often tymes, and let it not reſt when you are in the Haven nor in the Streame, whereby in ſayling out and into the river, you ſhall knowe what countries are flattes, or ſhoring that you may beware of them, &amp; when you are a comming without the Land, then you muſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly marke what hilles or downes lie there aboutes, what chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, towers, caſtels, or other markes ſtand upon them, and thoſe you muſt note and counterfeit with a pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne upon ſeverall ſtrokes of the compaſſe, as they change their forme of ſtanding by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling along by them, oftentymes uſing the lead, all which being perfectly noted, it will be a great help unto you to know the ſaid Landes, when you come thither again.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe when you paſſe by any ſtrange Countrie, and ſayle along ſo near by it that you may plainly ſee it, then take the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit or forme thereof with a penne, to knowe in what manner they ſhewe themſelves upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch ſtrokes of the compaſſe, &amp; there let the lead fall, to ſee what depth and ground is there, which for your memorie you muſt alſo note, for that which you marke in that manner will ſtaye longer by you, then that which you have but ſimplie ſeen, and heard of of an other. But when you come againſt any Pointes or Havens, where you meane to lade or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade, there you muſt take good heede unto your courſe, &amp; marke how you ſayle by that Land or Haven, and when you ſee any markes or towres, you muſt note them with a penne, and bring the markes and pointes both well together, thereby to goe right into the river, &amp; to guide you by the lead til you be in, &amp; when you are within and at an anker, then viſite all the pointes of the Haven, and note them downe with a penne cardewiſe, how they reach outward and inward, that when you come thither againe, you might enter into the ſame place againe, and knowe the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation thereof, but when you are in the open Sea, and the winde againſt you ſo that you lye by the winde, both on the one ſide and the other, then you muſt marke how long you muſt lye on the one bought or on the other, and when you muſt turne. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this you muſt ſpecially note how much the ſhip goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and what you may ſayle in one meale, &amp; how the ſhip ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to the which ende you ſhall ſome times let the lead, or the lead line with a peece of wood hang out behinde, to ſee how much the ſhip windeth, and how much the waves caſteth it out of the right courſe that it ſhould hold. This you muſt doe upon your compaſſe everie evening and morning, and note it in your memoriall, that you may caſt it over and peruſe it againe in the Cardes, whether in noting or marking it, you ſhould have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to have miſtaken your ſelf. You muſt likewiſe take heed to your ſteering, to ſee how much you muſt winde on either ſide in
<pb facs="tcp:17769:23"/> your Carde. And further when you finde a good &amp; ſure height, by your Croſſe-ſtaffe or Aſtrolabium, that will give you a good ſecuritie of your right geſſing, ſo that your compaſſing agreeth alſo with it, and then you ſhall certainely ſee in your Carde how all pointes and Countries lye from you, but if your geſſing and your height agree not together, then you muſt warily correct your geſſing according to your height, and ſee as near as you can whether you faile either to litle or to much in your geſſing, and all this muſt be done with good skill and underſtanding in your Carde, and when you come to the place where you wil ſeeke for Land, then without doubt you ſhall land in ſuch a place as your Inſtrument &amp; good geſſing ſhewe you.</p>
               <p>To learne to knowe all courſes and ſtrokes perfectly by hart, to that end you muſt take the printed Carde and read it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes over, and everie courſe &amp; ſtroke which you finde to meet you muſt place togither: as from Cape Finiſtere to Ciſarga, the Weſt-coaſt of England, the Coaſt of Flanders, the Coaſt of Freeſland, of Hartſhals to Schagen and ſuch like. The like you muſt doe with the tydes, to wete, you muſt note all the places (where the Mone maketh a high water upon any point or ſtroke of the Compaſſe) by each other in a Regiſter, as in the table of the tydes hereafter enſeuing you may ſee: and he that doth ſo, without doubt ſhall doe all things right and perfectly, and ſhall beare about him al the experience, and knowledge of Seafaring, needful &amp; neceſſarie, which no man in the world can take from, or bereave him of.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the Water-tydes and how a man ſhall reckon them perfectly by the Moone.</head>
               <p>VVee have hereunto added certaine tables of the Water-tydes, as they are commonly uſed by Pilots, wherein is ſhewed upon what pointes or ſtrokes of the Compaſſe the Moone muſt be, before it maketh a high water in any of the places ſet down in the tables, but you muſt underſtand, that you muſt not take or reckon ſuch ſtrokes or pointes according to our common Compaſſe lying flat, or driving water-compaſſe, but onely the north &amp; ſouth pointes, for they muſt be eſteemed not after the Horizon or Kimmen, but according to the flatte or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall part of the Aequinoctiall. Therefore if you will take the Sonne or Moone by or with the common Compaſſe, then you muſt lift up the ſide of the Compaſſe ſo much, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof may ſtand right againſt the Aequinoctiall, &amp; that the pinne in the middle ſhoweth right to the Pole, and ſo you may take the Sonne or Moone thereafter, which will be a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from a Compaſſe that lyeth flatte: for at the height of fiftie degrees, or there aboutes, and the Sonne being in Cancer, in his higheſt ſigne, that is in the higheſt declination, it will be half an houre before eight of the clocke before it commeth into the Eaſt, and half an houre before five before it come into the Weſt. If you take it by a flatte Compaſſe, that is he goeth from Eaſt to Weſt in nine houres, and againe from Weſt to Eaſt in 15 houres. At the height of thirtie degrees, he commeth firſt a litle before half an houre paſt nine into the Eaſt, &amp; a litle before half an houre paſt two into the Weſt, ſo that in leſſe then five houres and an half he goeth from Eaſt to Weſt, &amp; full eighteene houres and an half before he commeth againe from Weſt to Eaſt: and ſeeing that the Moone ſome times makes his declination five de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees more northerly then the Sonne, ſo it may chance that the Moone may goe an houre &amp; more faſter from the Eaſt into the Weſt then the Sonne, ſo that he that will alwaiſe take the Sonne or Moone by our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Compaſſe, ſhall often tymes much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him ſelf if he ſhould reckon his tides thereafter, whether it were requiſite to ſtoppe any tides, or to enter into any havens: to prevent that, I have in the tables enſeuing noted upon what houre and minute the Moone co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth upon ſuch pointes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the floodes are ruled, wherein onely it is neceſſarie to knowe the age of the Moone, that is how many tydes are paſt from the tyme of the new or ful Moone, for the firſt part of the table ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the age of the Moone everie day, that is how many dayes are paſt ſince the new or full Moone. The ſecond part of the table ſheweth the houre and minutes when the Moone upon the ſame dayes commeth to the ſame ſtroke, as you may ſee on the toppe thereof, and right againſt it ſtandeth the places where the Moone then maketh a high Water. As for example the Moone being 8 dayes old, I would know when it will be ſouthweſt or northeaſt, then I looke for the point of ſouthweſt, and in the firſt columne of cyfers ſtanding under it, I tell eight downwards, or looke into the place where 8 ſtandeth, and againſt it in the ſecond columne I find 9 houres 24 minutes, and at ſuch a tyme it is then high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the places that are noted downe right againſt it, as at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, Rotterdam, &amp;c. or there a ſouthweſt or northeaſt Moone makes a full Sea.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> How you shall finde the tyme of the new and ful Moone.</head>
               <p>THe former Tables of the Water-tydes are unprofitable &amp; not to be uſed, when the age of the Moone is not known, and therefore we have hereunto added, an Almanack for the next tenne yeeres, one enſeuing the other, wherein you may perfectly finde when it is a new or full Moone, and alſo the juſt tyme of the quarters.</p>
               <p>Which to underſtand, you muſt firſt knowe, that all Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers reckon the day from one noone tyme to another, and to that ende reckon from one noone to the noone next after enſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 24 houres, which cuſtome alſo is obſerved in theſe Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks, thereby to ſhewe the difference betweene forenoone and afternoone. But to finde the tyme of the newe Moone or full Moone or of the quarters, then note firſt that there are two parts of the Almanacke noted with figures, the firſt ſhewing the daye of the Moneth ſtanding againſt it whereon the Moone is new, full or in the quarters, The ſecond ſheweth the houre and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of the ſame day: which perfectly to underſtand I will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by an example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anno 1612 I deſire to know in the moneth May, when it will be full Moone, to that ende I looke into the Almanack of Anno 1612, in the moneth May, &amp; there I finde the full Moone, upon the 14 day, at 9 of the clock 38 minutes, that is at 9 in the night: but the new Moone in the ſame Month, is the 29 day, 22 houres and 33 minutes, that is ſo many houres after noone of that day, and therefore if you tell from the ſaid noone 22 houres 33 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, then you will finde that it ſhall be upon the 30 day at 10 of the clock and 33 minutes before noone. But to know upon what day of the weeke it is, you muſt firſt know the Sondayes letter for the yeere-and alſo with what letter everie moneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes. the Sondayes letter you ſhall finde noted under everie ſeverall yeeres Almanack. The Leape yeeres have 2 Sondayes or Dominicall letters, the firſt is uſed untill the 25 day of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, the other from the 25 of Februarie unto the ende of the yeere, but with what letter each moneth beginneth, that you ſhall finde in this table enſeuing.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIIII.</hi> How at all tymes you ſhall finde the New Moone, or her age, without help of any Almanack.</head>
               <p>VVhereunto it is requiſite to know the Golden number, whereby you knowe the Epact or Keye of the yeere: the Golden number riſeth everie yeere one, that is with the beginning of the yeere to the number of 19, ſo that everie 19 yeeres it goeth about, or makes an ende; then againe it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. To finde it in ſuch a yeere as you deſire, do thus: ſee how many yeeres are paſt ſince Anno 1500, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide by 19, and that which reſteth is the Golden number, but if nothing reſteth, that is, that even 19 partes are produced out of it, then your Golden number is 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſire to knowe the Golden number Anno 1608, ſetting the 1500 aſide, I looke how many times 19 there is in 108 yeres, and I finde 5, and 13 remaining, which 13 is the Golden num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for that yeere, the like muſt be done with al the other yeres.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Epact.</head>
                  <p>THe Epact or Keye of the yeere, altereth everie yeere up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 1 of March next after enſeuing, riſing everie yeere 11 to the number of 30, &amp; when it is more then 30, then take 30 out of it, and the reſt is the Epact: and ſo everie yeere reckon 11 more as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>But the Epact of the Olde Stile is alwaies 10 more then the New Stile, becauſe the Olde Stile followeth 10 dayes after the Newe Stile: ſo that if you adde 10 to the Epact of the Newe Stile, then you have the Epact of the Olde Stile: but if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber riſeth higher then 30, then leave 30 and that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth is the Epact of the Olde Stile, which you ſhall clearly ſee in the table enſeuing.</p>
                  <p>How much the Epact is in everie yeere, you may perceive by this table, namely right againſt the Golden number, which to know without looking in a booke, you muſt do thus. Count the Golden number upon the three joyntes of your thumb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with one at the undermoſt joynte, and count ſo long until you come to the Golden number of the yeere that you require, and if it endes on the undermoſt joynt of your thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>b then the Golden Number and the Epact is al one number; but if it endeth on the middle joynt of your thumb, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adde 10 to your Golden number, &amp; that will be the Epact; but if it endeth upon the ende of your thumb, then you muſt adde 20 to your Golden number, and then you ſhall finde the Epact.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of the Sea-cardes.</head>
               <p>IT is well knowne unto everie man, ſpecially to all thoſe that underſtand the groundes of Coſmographie, that the Earth and the Sea together is a round bodie or Globe, ſo that it is impoſſible in ſuch ſort to ſet downe and ſhewe the ſame, or the partes thereof in one plat forme, or carde, that they may be well diſtinguiſhed without error, for it is impoſſible to make a thing that is round to be like in all proportions with that which is flatte, ſo that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon flatte Sea-cardes many tymes in ſome places are untrue, ſpecially thoſe that ſet forth great voyages, farre from the Equinoctiall: but the Sea-cardes that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed here aboutes for the Eaſt &amp; Weſt voyages by Sea, they are reaſonable true, or els the faults therin are ſo ſmale, that they cannot be any hinderance thereunto: they are moſt fitt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be uſed by ſea, and our old farefathers which firſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed them did great pleaſure, &amp; profit unto Seafaring men. The want that we finde in them, conſiſteth herein, &amp; is thus found: If a man were to ſayle to a place with three points into the Sea, the two firſt points might be ſayled by their ſtrokes and diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but from the ſecond to the third place (that is the third ſide of the triple point) it wil fayle both in the ſtretching and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſayle from the Lezard with a right courſe to the Ilands of Canaria, and from thence againe to the Ilands of Corvo &amp; Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, for the which two ſtrokes and diſtances my Carde is well made, but if I wil ſayle again from Corvo to Lezard fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence I firſt ſayled the Carde will ſhewe me an imperfect courſe, that is it will ſhew farther in the Carde then it is, and it ſhal differ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the ſtretching, ſo that you muſt ſet your courſe more nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly then the Carde ſheweth.</p>
               <p>In our ſhort wayes, as aforeſaid, this is not much marked, &amp; is litle eſteemed, but they that ſayle to Weſt-India, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it well ynough. When they ſayle outward, they hold their way farre ſouthward, and there finde their Cardes juſt with their due lengths, becauſe the Cardes are made for the purpoſe: but returning home againe, when they hold their courſe nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, then they finde the way to be ſhorter then their Cardes ſhew it. The cauſe thereof is this, all the lines in flat Sea cardes from ſouth to north, are al over drawn juſt even each ſom other, from the Equinoctiall to the Pole: but upon a round Globe, which is made in forme like the Earth, they are not of alike wideneſſe, but the more Northerly they are, the nearer they come one to the other, ſo that two ſtrokes of ſouth and north, at the breadth of 60 degrees, are but half ſo wide one from the other as upon the Equinoctiall Line, and under the Pole they fall cloſe together. Wherefore if two ſhips being under the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall, diſtant from each other 200 leagues, both of them may ſayle right north without let or hinderance, &amp; they would come to the height of 60 degrees, and be but 100 leagues one from the other, and if they ſhould hold on the ſame courſe, they would at laſt meet both together under the Pole, but if you ſhould prick the courſe of thoſe two ſhippes in a flat Sea-carde, the diſtances in the Carde would remaine alike, whereby it is playnely ſeene, that al places in the Sea-cardes lying farr north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward are much to great, unles they be drawne leſſe, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be done, without making other places falſer, but how all ſuch places may be made even, and holpen you may ſee it in the Sea-cardes of Weſt India, which were printed and made by us.</p>
               <p>Amongſt manie Pilots there is an opinion, that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe the written Cardes, then ſuch as are printed, eſteeming the printed Cardes to be imperfect, and ſay that the written
<pb facs="tcp:17769:30"/> Cardes are much better and perfecter, they meane the written Cardes that are dayly made by men, are everie day corrected, &amp; the printed never: but herein they are not a litle deceived, for the printed Cardes in each reſpect are as good, yea &amp; better then the written, for that the printed Cardes are once in everie point with al care and diligence made perfect, in regard that they ſerve for many, for that being once well made, all the reſt may with as litle labour be made good as wel as bad. But the Sea-cardes that are written can not be made ſo ſound nor with ſuch ſpeed, becauſe ſo much coſt for one peece alone were to much, but are all one after the other, with the leaſt labour copied out, and many tymes by ſuch perſons that have litle or no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therein. Whatſoever there is yet reſting to be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or made better, is as eaſie to be corrected in the Cardes that are printed, as in them that are written, which wee alſo are readie to doe at our charge, if any man can by good pro ſhewe us any thing that is to be corrected in the Cardes that are printed by us.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O ſayle from Amſterdam to the fal of Urck, you muſt ſayle in the middle of the water to Tyort, and if you wil ſayle from thence over Pampus, with a ſhip that drawes much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (that is at leaſt tenne foot or more) then keep Marker church without upon the Land of Udam, called Schyteldoecks haven, ſo long till the Steeple of Zuyderwou commeth even with Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigherbuert: which are the houſes that ſtand half way between Schyteldoecks haven &amp; Diergerdam, then goe eaſtward to the Land, untill the New church of Amſterdam joynes with Dier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdam, &amp; keepe the New-church ſtanding ſo, until the church of Weeſp is even with the houſe of Muyen,<note place="margin">Markes of the deepeſt water of Pampus.</note> if that the church of Muyen ſtandeth nearer then the houſe, kepe Weeſp ſtanding ſo until you ſee Edam without the eaſt ende of Marcken. In this chanel it is almoſt a foot deeper then if you ſayle right through.</p>
                        <p>But to ſhunne Muyer-ſand Mariners were woont to bring the houſes that were woont to ſtand upon Tyort, ſouthward of the Heyliger-ſtee of Amſterdam, there by a man may make ſome geſſe,<note place="margin">Markes of Muyder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</note> and they are good long-markes: but when Monni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedam is about the weſt ende of Schiteldoecks haven, and the houſe of Muyen between Weeſp and Muyen church, then you are againſt Muyderſand. But to ſayle right through over Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, you muſt keepe Diemer ſteeple, above or againſt the point of Tyort, as long as you may ſee Tyort, for that is a right long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke to ſayle over Pampus.</p>
                        <p>When you are right againſt the eaſt ende of Marken, then you muſt goe northeaſt, and ſomewhat more eaſterly to the fall of Urck, which is almoſt ſeven leagues from thence: but when you come within a league of Urck, then you come to a hard ſand called Houtrib, which ſtretcheth ſoutheaſt and northweſt croſſe over the water, which hath no moore water upon it, then is upon the flattes of Wieringen or Vrieſland, ſo that you can finde no deeper water upon it then right through.<note place="margin">Markes of the Hout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib.</note> When En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuyſen is northweſt, &amp; northweſt-by-weſt from you then you are upon the Houtrib, when Urck lyeth more northerly, then northeaſt from you, &amp; that you finde Sand that is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Houtrib, for you can not ſayle ſo by Enchuyſen ſand, you are not at Enchuyſen ſand, before that Urck church is ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the buert of houſes that ſtand upon Urck: or when the walles of the old church ſtand right againſt the middle of the buert, then you are about Enchuyſen ſand,<note place="margin">Markes of Enchuyſen ſand.</note> then ſayle northweſt &amp; by weſt til Medenblick commeth without the point of Ven, then goe weſt-north-weſt to the tonne upon Hofſtede.</p>
                        <p>Betweene Urck and the Hofſtede tonne there lyeth a flatt of hard ſand, reaching to the ende of Enchuyſen ſand,<note place="margin">The flatto betweene Vrck and Hofſtede.</note> which is no deeper then the Vrieſ-flatt: eaſtward about is the deepeſt water, &amp; on the weſt ſide, (which by ſome men is called Cat-gat) you are ſooner about the High-horne or Enchuyſen ſand, and it is good for ſhips that goe not deep: when Enchuyſen ſteeple is ſouthweſt or more weſterly from you, then you are upon the flatte.</p>
                        <p>The Croſſe-markes of the tonnes both upon the Creupel &amp; Hofſtede are Grootebroeck and Hem,<note place="margin">Markes of the tonnes betweene Hofſtede and the Cripple.</note> which are two ſharp ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples comming right over againſt each other, then alſo if a ſharp ſteeple called Warnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth on the ſouth-ſide of Stavern clif, then you have the length of theſe tonnes, which lye both at 3 fathome, the one upon the eaſt banck, the other upon the point of the Creupel, the right chanel is here 4 fathomes and an half ſoft ground.<note place="margin">Markes of Cripple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</note> When the ſteeple of Medenblick is northward of Medenblick howſe, as farr as the breadth of the houſe, then you have gone by and paſt Creupel ſand, then goe to the tonne that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17769:34"/> lyeth by Kreil, north-weſt, &amp; north-weſt-by-north, as the winde &amp; the ſtreame is, the right Chanel here is ſcarſe 5 fathome. But when you come againſt the Kreil, in ſayling out, or about the Kreil ſayling in, there lyeth right within the Kreil, on the north ſide a hard ſand or flatte called South-Kreil, which reacheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long towards the tonne at the Hofſtede, there at a lowe water it is but 9 foot deep: but between this banck &amp; the north wal it is 3 fathome deepe, ſoft ground, and ſouth or weſt it is 4 fathome and an half deepe.<note place="margin">Markes of the flattes betweene the Kreil &amp; the Hof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtede.</note> The markes of this flatt are, when Mirnes a flat ſteeple in Frieſland is right over a long Land-houſe, which ſtandeth ſouthward from Stavern church, then you are right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſaid flatt.</p>
                        <p>But the markes of the tonne that lyeth before Kreil are tehſe when the ſharp ſteeple of Twiſch, which ſtandeth weſtward from Memelick, is right againſt the Corne-mill, that ſtandeth weſtward from Memelick,<note place="margin">Markes of the ton at the Creil.</note> and when the flatte Steeple of Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is againſt the ſouth ſide or eaſt ſide of the Clif, then you are at the tonne which lyeth at the Kreil, and the Chanell is there 4 fathome and an half, and 5 fathome ſoft ground. But the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne lyeth upon 4 fathome, and when neceſſitie compelleth you, you may ſayle a cables length eaſtward about, then from the tonne at the Kreil, to the tonne at the Freeſe Plact, the courſe is north and by eaſt, when Twiſck is right north from Memelick, then keepe the ſteeple ſtanding ſo, as long as you can ſee it, &amp; ſo you ſhall not ſayle upon any ſhallowes betweene the Plaet and the Kreil.</p>
                        <p>Betweene the tonne at the Kreil, and the Freeſe Plaet, on the weſt ſhore there lyeth a hard ſand called Monickſand,<note place="margin">Monicſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> which you may ſhunne well, when you are ſome what out of the way, but when you are about the Kreil, then you muſt goe north &amp; by eaſt, right through over the point of Breeſand, to the tonne lying weſt from Worcum, with a ſhip that draweth not much water, but the right Chanell is deeper as followeth.</p>
                        <p>If you ſayle with a ſhip that draweth much water, over the Freeſ-flatte, then ſet the flat ſteeple of Pandraghen (ſtanding weſt of Worcum) ſo,<note place="margin">Markes of the ton at the Freeſ-plaet.</note> that it may ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d weſt from the houſes that lye weſtward from Worcum, that is a good Long-marke for the tonne that lyeth at the Freeſ-Plaet.

The ſecond tonne lyeth at three fathome and an half water, the third at the riſing of the threſhold, at three fathome, the fourth at the dryeſt of the entrie, at two fathome, but the fift tonne againe lyeth at three fathome, and being at it, you are paſt the ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: al the tonnes in the Maſe lye on the north ſide of the haven, and are ſo neare one unto the other, that a man may eaſily ſee from the one to the other, you muſt ſayle betweene the tonnes and the land, three or four ſhippes length ſouthward from the tonne it is the deepeſt water.

When Blanckenburgh ſtandeth ſoutheaſt and by eaſt from you, then upon the Trip it is 6 fathome deepe with a lowe water, and the more weſterly the deeper upon the Trip.

                        <p>This banck aforeſaid reacheth along the land of Swarteneſſe, and lyeth neareſt to the French ſide, it is at leaſt 4 leagues long, on both ſides of this banck, both on the eaſt and weſt ſides it is 20 and 21 fathome deepe.</p>
                        <p>Croſſe from the weſt-head of Calis there lyeth a banck of 2 fathome, you may ſayle betweene the head or Mayeland &amp; this banck at 3 fathome, with half flood, you may anckor under Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Cliffe<note place="margin">Rode to anckor un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der Calis Cliffe.</note> at the eaſt ende at 10 fathome water, but at the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ende of Calis Cliffe there lyeth a Rocke under the water the length of a Culver ſhot from the land. The high land betweene Calis and Swarteneſſe is called Calis Cliffe.</p>
                        <p>A league &amp; an half ſouthward from Calis lyeth Swarteneſſe,<note place="margin">Swartenes.</note> which is a foule point lying out, by the which there lyeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Rockes, you cannot anckor there, for the ground in that place is verie foule. A litle waie ſouthward of Swarteneſſe there ſtand ſome fewe houſes with a mill, all along to the mill you may not anckor, but you will indure ſome hurt and dammage either in your cables or anckors.</p>
                        <p>Two leagues ſouthward from Swarteneſſe lyeth the Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or <hi>Tour d'ordre,</hi>

To anckor there you muſt bring the ſteeple of the village againſt the middle of the houſes, but there lyeth ſome rockes along by the land, which you muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſhunne, and goe not neare unto them.</p>
                        <p>About two leagues from Tour d'ordre lyeth Beunen or Bullen, and when ſuch as lye at anckor under the Oldman goe on land they may from above looke downe into the River of Bullen.</p>
                        <p>Betweene Tour d'ordre &amp; the Somme<note place="margin">Somme.</note> there is a great creeke, and when you are right againſt the Somme it is ſhallowe water, 3 or 4 leagues at the leaſt into the Sea, about 6 or 7 fathome deepe, ſuch ſhippes as come out of the weſt, are many tymes caſt away there, but when you finde ſhallow water for a long tyme, you muſt underſtand that you are about the river of Somme.</p>

                        <p>The courſe from the Oldman to the river of Somme is ſouth and north, diſtant 8 or 9 leagues, and from Bullen to Somme<note place="margin">Somme.</note> it is ſouth, and ſouth and by weſt, diſtant 6 leagues.

Some Shippers and Saylers are much deceived herein, which know not theſe Rocks, calling the land of Chierburch the great Kiſcas, and the land of Ornay the ſmall Kiſcas, for the Kiſcaſſes are nothing els but meere rockes lying out in the Sea. About w. n. w. and w. &amp; by n. from this Iland of Ornay or Aldernex, there lye two other ſmooth great Rockes, called Barroches,<note place="margin">Barroches.</note> which lye on the weſt ende of Ornay cloſe by the land.</p>

                        <p>IF you will ſayle up the River of Nantes,<note place="margin">The River of Nantes.</note> and are within the banck called the Four, then you muſt runne to the land of Croiſwyke, half a peeces ſhotte along by it, untill you come to the Rock with the hole, where you ſee through as if it were a gate, there in the chanel it is deepe 8 &amp; 9 fathome, but againſt the rock it is 5 or 6 fathome deepe, and when you goe by the north point of the river, it is there 3 &amp; 4 fathome deepe at lowe water, within to S. Nazaret it is ſtill deeper water, as 5, 6, and 7 fathome. S. Nazaret<note place="margin">S. Nazaret</note> is a ſharp ſteeple ſtanding upon an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, a litle within the north point of the River. The Rock with the hole is called Pierrepaſſe, from it you muſt runne at two towes length in, upon the north point of the River, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſharp ſteeple called S. Nazaret ſtandeth, untill you are within the rocks called les Porceaux,<note place="margin">The Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaux.</note> which lye in the middle of the River, betweene the Rock with the hole and the ſteeple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and appeare above the water at half tyde. A litle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in S. Nazaret, upon the northland ſtandeth a ſharp ſpere ſteeple, when that ſteeple is without the ſouth land, then you cannot hurt your ſelf upon that rocke, &amp; there runne northward about. A litle eaſtward there lyeth another ſand with rocks, where you may runne eaſtward about with great ſhippes, for there it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie flatte to the point: being within the point, you may anckor at 6 or 7 fathome. Eaſtward from S. Nazaret there lye two villages, betweene thoſe villages it is verie flat, &amp; ſtone ground, there you muſt chuſe the ſouth land. But when you are half waie betweene the eaſterlyeſt village, then you may ſayle upon the point of the village, till you be paſt it, but againſt the eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt village on the ſouth ſide, at the point there lyeth a banck called Pinbuf,<note place="margin">Pinbuf.</note> it reacheth almoſt half into the River, yet you may goe betweene the point and this banck at 5 or 6 fathome, for this is the Rode for ſhippes that will put to Sea.</p>
                        <p>A league further inwards in the middle of the River, there lye two banckes of ſtones, which at lowe water are ſeene above it, theſe banckes lye in the chanel. At Pelerin<note place="margin">Pelerin.</note> is the lading place, almoſt three leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Nantes, from whence the wares come in boates to lade the ſhippes. But this is Pilot water, which you commonly take in by the aforeſaid ſharpe towre of S. Nazaret, where when you are within, you may anckor at 10 or 12 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome, and ſtaye for a Pilot. Thoſe that from S. Nazaret will goe to Sea againe, muſt doe as followeth, ſayle along by the northland, untill you come without the ſecond point of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, turne then off from the north land into the middle of the River, and ſayle a great way ſouthward about Pierrepaſſe, and then when you may ſee the rock (which lyeth north from Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repaſſe) without the point, there it is four fathome and an half deepe, and when Pierrepaſſe is north-northweſt, and n. &amp; by w. from you, then you are right againſt the rocke, and there you have deeper water, at 5, 6, and at laſt 7 fathome, but when you come into the Trave of Picqueliers, then you have 10 and 12 fathome water.</p>
                        <p>Before the River of Nantes there lye many banckes, but at half flood you may well goe over them. And the ſouth point of the River of Nantes, is diſtant from the north point, n. n. w. &amp; ſ. ſ. e. 4. leagues. Then this land runneth into a great creeke, and there men runne into the Baye. Theſe uneven banckes in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Nantes are verie unlike, ſometymes you caſt 15 fathome, and preſently after but 7 or 8 fathome.</p>
                        <p>But to ſayle from Bel-Iſle to the baye of Armentiers,<note place="margin">To ſayle to the baye.</note> then goe on e. ſ. e. till you ſee the Cloſter of Armentiers, but before the River of Nantes it is uneven and banckie, when you ſee the Cloſter of Armentiers<note place="margin">Armen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</note> eaſtward from the trees which ſtand into landward beyond the ſaid Cloſter, then goe forward eaſt, and e. and by n. ſo long untill that the Cloſter commeth within the caſtle of Armentiers, then you are within the Monck-lege,<note place="margin">Monck-lege.</note> then goe e. ſ. e. untill you are within the rock called Pierremen,<note place="margin">Pierremen</note> which you may goe about on both ſides, and when you may ſee the Grave open, then you may anckor at 7 or 8 fathome, &amp; goe on land to fetch a Pilot, for it is Pilots water.

                        <p>FRom Cap Cantin to the point of Saffia the courſe is ſouth and ſomewhat weſterlyer 5 leagues. From Cape Cantin as aforeſaid there ſhooteth off a ſtonie Sand, which you muſt ſhunne, when you are paſt that Sand you ſee two or three rockes as a veſſel or boate in a Sandbaye, and the land there is round about black to looke on, whereby you ſhall knowe that you are not farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the point of Saffia.<note place="margin">C. Cantin.</note> Cape Cantin is a lowe ſmoth point, whereon there ſtandeth a fire-towre, there about it is all even and ſmothe land, as if it were Normandie, along from Aſamor to Saffia, ſo that you may knowe it well by the plainneſſe. When you ſall a litle northward from the point of Saffia, or put to land, then upon the plaine land you ſee two houſes, the one (which is eaſterlyeſt) is called Caſa Cavalgero, and the other ſtandeth upon Cape de Cantin, which is the fire-towre aforeſaid.</p>
                        <p>He that wil anckor in the Baye or Rode before Saffia,<note place="margin">Saffia.</note> let him place the point a litle more weſterlyer then north from him, it is there almoſt 18 fathome deepe, but he that deſireth to ſette further within the boucht, muſt ſet the northerlyeſt point of both, a ſhippes length without the other which lyeth neareſt to you, then thoſe pointes will be northnorthweſt and north &amp; by weſt from you, &amp; the thicke towre on the ſouth-ſide of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Saffia, will then be eaſt, and e. &amp; by n. from you, there is the beſt Rode at 10, 11 and 12 fathome, you may anckor alſo ſo much further inward, untill the pointes be almoſt hard by each other, &amp; that the towres, which you goe by on land, are againſt the thick towre which ſtandeth above upon the caſtle, there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is good anckoring, this Baye is a round Baye or Creeke, when you fall ſouthward from Saffia, you muſt underſtand that the land ſouthward from Saffia is high and uneven land, &amp; moſt part double land, ſo that thereby you may eaſely knowe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be north or ſouth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Saffia, for the land on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of Saffia (as I ſaid before) is lowe and plaine ground.</p>
                        <p>From the point of Saffia to the Iland of Mogodor it is ſouth-ſoutheaſt 16 or 17 leagues,<note place="margin">Iland of Mogodor.</note> and ſo the land reacheth from Saffia to Mogodor, &amp; alſo forth to Cape de Geer, the land is all high and double land, and it is all faire ſandie ſtrand.</p>
                        <p>Againſt the north-ende of the Iland Mogodor, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſhooting off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faſt land a great rowe of hard rockes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the utmoſt, or they which lye next to the Iland Mogodor lye high above the water, he which commeth out of the north, and will ſayle beyond Mogodor, he muſt runne betweene the Iland, and the foreſaid rockes, hard by the rockes, it is in the entrie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Iland and the rockes five fathome deepe. Within the foreſaid rockes there lye on baghborde certaine other rockes, which at high water lye under water, &amp; at lowe water appeare above water, when you come to the ende of them, then you may runne about toward the firme land, and there anckor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the rockes at 3 fathome lowe water: there is faire ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17769:94"/> but notwithſtanding there is not verie good riding: for becauſe of the breaking of the Sea upon the aforeſaid rockes, it taketh there verie ſtrongly, ſo that with a ſtorme there is verie daungerous lying in that place: but further inward behinde the Iland it is good lying at 2 fathome and an half. From the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ende of the Iland ſtretcheth out a litle rock toward the firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: almoſt againſt the foot-ſtrand, but ſouthward from the foreſaid litle rock there ſtretcheth out a banck from the firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land a league into the Sea. If you will ſayle out at the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ende, then runne along by the ſhore of the firme-land till you are about the foreſaid litle rock, and then runne out with the plummet by the banck: and then preſently you ſhall finde dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per water as 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, fathome, then ſayle whether you pleaſe.</p>
                        <p>From the point of Saffia to Cape de Geer it is ſouth-ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt 48 leagues,<note place="margin">C. de Geer.</note> but from Mogodor the ſame courſe it is 31 leagues, betweene them both about northeaſt 7 or 8 leagues from Cape de Geer, there lyeth a point called Cap de Taffala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,<note place="margin">Cap de Tafalana.</note> there you may anckor under it ſafe, againſt eaſt &amp; northeaſt windes, there it is all ſandie ſtrand.

                        <p>He that will anckor in the Baye or in the Rode of Cape de Geer,<note place="margin">Rode of C de Geer.</note> he muſt runne ſo farre into the Creeke till the Moores ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle be north from him, then the Chriſtians packhouſes will be northeaſt from him, and there it will be 7 or 8 fathome deepe, the north-point will then lye northweſt &amp; by weſt from him, &amp; there ſhooteth out a litle ſand, againſt the caſtle there lyeth a rowe of rockes under the water, and there ſoutherly you goe in to anckor, againſt the Chriſtians packhouſes it is the beſt rode.

                        <p>From Cape de Claro to the aforeſaid Cape de Velho or Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the courſe is eaſt and by north 12 leagues.<note place="margin">To goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ilands of C. de Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro.</note> To runne into the Ilands of Cap de Claro, you muſt underſtand that there ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a towne weſtward upon the high land, you muſt there goe eaſt to land, and ſo goe in eaſtnortheaſt, leaving the lowe Iland to landwards, and the uttermoſt Iland of Cape de Claro to ſeawards, and ſo running in to the ſecond Iland, whereon the cloſter of Claro ſtandeth, there on the weſt-ende there is a ſandie baye, where you may anckor at eight or nine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome.</p>
                        <p>There goeth alſo a chanel into the Sea cloſe alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g by the weſt Iland, which is 12 fathome deepe, on the eaſt-ſide of the chanel
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17769:104"/> there lyeth a rock above the water, which you muſt ſhunne, and in ſayling out you leave it on the eaſt-ſide, and right within the rock you may anckor.</p>
                        <p>If you will ſayle further into this haven of Cape de Claro, you muſt runne through betweene the Ilands to Baldermore,<note place="margin">Balder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</note> and ſhunne ſomewhat the Iland of Cape de Claro, for from it there runne manie blinde rockes, therefore you muſt ſayle to the other Iland. But when you are half waie by the Ile of Cape de Claro, then you muſt make to the narrowe waie, to goe through it, it is therefore the moſt part all about three fathome deepe, but in the narrowe waie it is drie at lowe water, therefore you muſt goe over there with the tyde, there you may anckor on what ſide you will, whether it be under the cloſter at Claro, or on Baldermore-ſide, which is the eaſt-ſide, where it is 5 and 6 fathome deepe.</p>
                        <p>The haven of Baldermore goeth in north, and in it it is 11 or 12 fathome deepe at lowe water, on the eaſt-point of Balder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more there lye two high ſteepe rockes, as if they were ſteeples, the one ſomewhat higher then the other, &amp; there eaſtward there goeth in a haven, which is called Caſtle-haven.

Upon the ſaid North-point there lyeth a towne, called S. Davies, and from thence northward the land reacheth northeaſt and ſouthweſt.</p>

The ſaid Ilands are well to be knowne, thereby to knowe the ſaid point of Wales, the land there reacheth n. n. w. and ſ. ſ. e.</p>
                        <p>Right ſouth from the Iland of Greſholme lyeth Milford ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">Milford haven.</note> which firſt reacheth in n. e. which is a deepe and wide ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the middle thereof there lyeth an Iland, within it is verie good anckoring, for it is a good haven. About five Engliſh miles within the land there lyeth a towne called Carcewe.</p>
                        <p>Two leagues eaſtward from Milford lyeth S. Gawins point,<note place="margin">S. Gawins point.</note> which is the ſouth-point of Wales, which is alſo called the White-point.</p>
                        <p>Four or five leagues eaſtward from S. Grawins point lyeth the Iland of Caldye,<note place="margin">Caldye.</note> where you may anckor rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about againſt all windes. This Iland lyeth before a great Creeke, which al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is good rode. He that will goe before the towne of Tinbuy<note place="margin">Tinbuy.</note> he muſt take heede of a rowe of blinde rockes, which lye north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from Caldye under the Water, but if you will ſayle to Tinbuy, eaſtward from Caldye, you may ſayle cloſe along by the Iland: you may alſo come about weſt from Caldye, but there it is not verie wide, it is a ſtrait waie, but all through it is deepe ynough, &amp; being eaſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rockes you may anckor wel.</p>
                        <p>Eaſt from the Iland of Caldye there lyeth a white point, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wormſhead-point,<note place="margin">Wormes point.</note> which hath manie white chalck ſpottes on the land, whereby that point is well to be knowne. There eaſtward it is a good rode for weſt, north, and northeaſt and by eaſt windes, in a great creeke, and ſoutheaſt from this out-point there lyeth a great banck, which reacheth off from the Naes<note place="margin">The Naes.</note> w. &amp; by ſ. and w. ſ. w. five leagues.</p>
                        <p>You may alſo ſayle through this banck and the Naes to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyf or the Holme before Briſtowe, and this ſand is called Naes-ſand.</p>
                        <p>He that will goe into this baye or creeke eaſtward, he muſt ſayle in cloſe by the Naſe, or he muſt come out of the weſt, there it is wide and broad.</p>
                        <p>Eaſt from the Naſe there lye two Ilands, cloſe by the coaſt of Wales, the one called Barrey,<note place="margin">Barrey &amp; Sily.</note> the other Sily.

                        <p>Cardyf<note place="margin">Cardyf.</note> is a tyde-haven, but there is a verie faire rode for ſhips that will goe about eaſt or weſt, for there lye manie ſands eaſtward, which at lowe water are drie.</p>
                        <p>He that will goe into the rode of Cardyf, he muſt runne in betweene Flatholme and the point of Cardyf, but there lyeth a rock in the haven which he muſt ſhunne, there lyeth alſo a ſtone ſ. e. and ſ. e. &amp; by e. from the weſt-point of the land under the water: but when it is high water you may goe over all that that at half flood is not covered. Cardyf Rode is a faire rode, where you may lye ſafe againſt all windes.</p>

                        <p>To ſayle in the right chanel through betweene the Holme, you muſt goe neareſt to Flatholme ſide, for there is the deepeſt water, with an open winde you may ſayle as neare as you will, yea ſo neare as that you may caſt a ſtone thereon.

Heere you muſt keepe the Engliſh ſide, for the ſide of Wales is verie uneve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and full of banckes, which in manie places fall drie, you come no nearer that coaſt then 12 fathome, for in ſayling toward the coaſt at one caſt you ſhall have 10 fathome, and at the next be faſt on ground, and that wholly from Flatholme to over againſt Bruſt. When you are about Paſſies point you may ſayle along by the coaſt forward northerly to the River of Severne, that is alſo a faire River as Bruſt, fitte to ſayle into.</p>

But if you will ſayle into the haven of Poole, then ſhall you perceive another point bearing out, ſo ſoone as you are gone about the foreſaid point, by the which ſtandeth a high white ſteepe rock like a maſt, almoſt like the Needle on the weſt ende of Wight, there you may ſayle about at 4 or 5 fathome. Now when you are about the ſaid point with the needle goe forward northweſt, and you ſhall ſee right before you a high flat hill riſing up out of the other land, keepe that hill betweene both the ſhores, and ſayle right forward. But if it chance that you muſt laveere, then ſpare not your lead, &amp; runne no further weſtward as you croſſe, then that the foreſaid flatte hill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth upon the weſt-land: for ſo ſoone as the hill beginneth to come upon the weſt-land, you muſt turne, or els you ſhall preſently be on ground: when you be turned, then croſſe no further eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then that the foreſaid rock co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth upon the eaſt-downe, which is a high, graye, ſharp downe, lying upon the eaſt-ſide: if you hold theſe markes ſo, then you have water ynough at half flood. Where it is ſhalloweſt, at lowe water there is in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel 10 or 11 foot water, yet it floweth but five foot up and downe. A ſoutheaſt and northweſt moone maketh high water there: but it floweth twiſe in a tyde: for a ſouth and by eaſt moone maketh there alſo full Sea, and that commeth by reaſon of the fore-ebbe which falleth out of Wight. When you are within the chanel, then goe on northeaſt, and keepe the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons which ſtand on the eaſt-land on ſtarreborde, and goe up reaſonable cloſe. The ſhores on both ſides are verie ſteepe, and the chanel is not wide, but without the deepe or chanel it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie flatte. It is Pilots water.</p>

To ſayle into the North chanel, ſet the northerlyeſt or eaſterlyeſt cape upon the Schelling right upon Brandaris, then they will ſtand about ſ. ſ. w. from you, ſayle upon them almoſt to the Schellingh ſtrand, there you ſhall finde the tonne at 3 fathome, right without the eaſterlyeſt point of Peterſand, leave that to Seaward from you, and ſayle w. ſ. w. to the ſecond tonne, which lyeth at the eaſt ende of the Bos at 14 foot lowe water, and there againſt it is no deeper in the chanel, for thereabouts it is dryeſt, for when you are paſt it it is deeper againe, and you muſt leave that tonne on baghborde. From the ſecond tonne to the newe ligger,<note place="margin">Newe lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> (that is the third tonne, as you count them comming in) the courſe is w. ſ. w. that tonne lyeth at 2 fathome and an half, on the ſouth ſide, and there againſt it in the chanel it is 3 fathome &amp; an half deepe. When you are by this new ligger, then the middlemoſt cape and Brandaris ſtand one againſt the other, and are ſ. ſ. e. from you. From thence, or right n. n. w. there runneth a chanel through Peters ſand into the Sea, in it there is 3 fathome,<note place="margin">The Sle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ck or Gutter.</note> and without in the drumple 12 foot water. When you have the ſaid cape and Brandaris one againſt another, keepe them ſtanding ſo, and ſo you goe right out of that gutter: alſo when you will come in out of the Sea, and have the ſaid cape &amp; Brandaris one over againſt an other, and ſayle upon them, then you ſhall goe by the newe ligger into the north chanel, this is a faire gutter for ſmall ſhippes, the weſt ſide is ſhoring, but the eaſt ſide is flat, which you may altogether ſound with your lead.</p>

                        <p>BEfore the Vlie a ſoutheaſt and northweſt moone maketh a high water. What moone maketh a high water within the chanels of the Vlie and Teſſel ſtreame, and how the ſtreames runne there, it is at large deſcribed in the firſt Chapter of the firſt Book. Without the Vlie the ſtreames fall along by the land, till it be half flood or half ebbe, and then they begin to fall into Bomekins chanel, and to fall out againe. The fore-flood commeth over Bomekins ground, and ſo falleth into the Schellingh, out at the north chanel, ſo that the fore flood ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an ebbe in the north chanel, and to the contrarie the fore-ebbe maketh a flood there. Now when the flood beginneth to fall in, which is ſooner in Stortmelck then in Bomekins chanel, then it falleth verie ſtif upon the Schellingh, &amp; behinde Grindt into the Iettingh, which you muſt take heede of, but when the flood is about half ſpent, then it beginneth to fall right in, as in the deſcription alſo is ſhewed, but at the other chanels of Freeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the flood falleth ſooner in.</p>
                        <p>Without in Ameland chanel a ſoutheaſt &amp; northweſt moone maketh a full Sea, and alſo on the land.</p>
                        <p>At the ſame time it is alſo high water before the Scholbalgh, the Lauwers and the Schille.</p>
                        <p>Before Weſt Eems a ſoutheaſt &amp; northweſt moone alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth high water.</p>
                        <p>In the Eaſt Eems and in Borckummerbalgh a ſ. ſ. e. and n. n. w. moone maketh high water.</p>
                        <p>Before the towne of Embden a ſouth or ſouth and by weſt, and north and north and by eaſt moone maketh high water.</p>
                        <p>Before the chanels betweene the Eaſt Eems and the Weſer, a ſ. and ſ. &amp; by e. and a n. and n. &amp; by w. moone maketh high water.</p>
                        <p>Under Holie land with a n. n. e. and ſ. ſ. w. moone it is a full Sea.</p>
                        <p>Before the Weſer and before the Elve, a north and ſouth moone. There the flood commeth northweſt without, and the ebbe ſoutheaſt, and ſo fall ſtrongly over the grounds.</p>
                        <p>In the chanel betweene the Elve and the Vlie, the fore floods come out of the North Sea, and goe about with the Sonne, and fall but half the tyde along by the land, that is eaſtnortheaſt, &amp; the ebbe weſtſouthweſt.</p>

                        <p>TO ſayle from the Newe worke, or from Schor tonne to the Hever, you muſt underſtand that the courſe is north and ſouth, diſtant 11 leagues, but alwaies looke well to your ſtreames, for as I ſaid, the fore flood falleth verie ſtif croſſe over the grounds into the land, &amp; the ebbe contrarie, but when you are half waie, then you meete with Blawoort ſand (whereof I ſpake before) at the depth of two or three fathome.</p>
                        <p>But to ſayle from Holie land to the Hever, then goe on n. e. and ſomewhat eaſterlyer, according as the winde and ſtreame ſuffer, and runne upon the Grounds at 6 or 7 fathome, then you ſhall finde an indifferent high ſteeple, which on the toppe is ſharpe, it is called Pielworme,<note place="margin">Piel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worme.</note> ſet this ſteeple northeaſt and by north from you, and a maſt length ſouth from the ſoutherlyeſt Cowehouſe, which ſtandeth upon the Iland of Nubal,<note place="margin">Nubal.</note> keepe the ſteeple ſtanding ſo, and ſayle up to it, then you ſhall finde the uttermoſt tonne, then goe from the firſt tonne to the ſecond tonne northeaſt, and northeaſt and by eaſt, and comming to it, then Pielworme ſteeple will ſtand n. n. e. from you. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence the courſe inward is n. e. &amp; by e. and when you come a good waie in, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you finde two beacons ſtanding there on ſtarborde, upon a drie ſand called the Quade,<note place="margin">The Quade a drie ſand.</note> right over againſt it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the North chanel into the right Hever.

You may alſo ſayle from the Ile of Nubal into the right Hever, and then you come againſt the Quade againe into the right deepe, as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. To ſayle up into the Hever the courſe from the firſt bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con to the third is e. &amp; by n. ſayle along by the beacons, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them on ſtarborde.

                        <p>From the the third beacon to the two other beacons, the courſe is northeaſt and by eaſt, then you come to the Greene

                        <p>Without in the Hever the north ſide is ſhoring, therefore keepe by the ſouth ſide, till you are within all the beacons. The chanel is two fathome and an half deepe at half flood, and it is verie farre flatte water. There lyeth alſo a banck a good waie without the Hever, which you muſt remember when you will ſayle in.

                        <p>Betweene Haef-ſand or Haes-ſand and the Iland of Rim, there goeth another chanel in,<note place="margin">The Land deepe of Liſt.</note> of about a fathome and an half water.

                        <p>FRom the Haven of Liſt to Knuyts or Ryper chanel the courſe is north &amp; ſouth, about 7 leagues: but Ryper deepe and Holie land lye diſtant north and ſomewhat ſoutherly, and ſouth and ſomewhat eaſterly. To ſayle into Knuyts or Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per chanel, when you come out of the ſouth, then runne by the flat of Rim and Manu, about to the ſouth ende of Phanu, called South head or South point, then you ſhall ſee two capes or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons upon a drie ſand ſtand a litle ſouthward from South head, bring theſe beacons a litle before each other, that is, the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt or longeſt a litle, or a hand ſpake length north fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt or uttermoſt, then they wil ſtand eaſt, or ſomewhat norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from you, let them ſtand ſo, and there you ſhall finde the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt tonne, which lyeth at four fathome on the north land, which you muſt leave on baghborde, &amp; goe to the ſecond to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, e. and by ſ. and when you are by the firſt tonne, then you may ſee the ſecond, yet they lye a great waie one from the other, you muſt leave the ſecond tonne alſo on baghborde, keepe along by the ſouth land till, you be paſt the beacons, for there ſhooteth off a Flat from the uttermoſt beacon to the ſecond to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, which you muſt ſhunne ſomewhat. When you are paſt the beacons, then looſe becauſe of the Sand whereon the beacons ſtand, and there anckor where you will, for there it is deepe and ſhoring or ſteepe, there you can doe no harme. The Ryper ſhippes which come out lye there ſtaying for a winde. In this chanel it is 20 foot water at half flood, but at a high water it is not the beſt chanel, for it is narrowe and flat a great waie without: and then when you have gotten that, then you may ſee both the ſides of the land ravle, when the winde bloweth ſomewhat hard. But when you come out of the north, then you muſt ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne upon the ſouth ende of Phanu, untill you ſee the beacons aforeſaid, and then do as I ſhewed you before.

The north ende of Phanu is flat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie far. Now when you get deeper water, then you ſhal ſee three or four hillocks about northeaſt from you, upon the high land, with a flat ſteeple called Holm or Bruynum, bring this church a cables length north from the hillocks, and then when you have the depth, then thoſe markes are northeaſt from you, then goe in n. e. and keepe the ſouth ſide, till you come within by the drie ſand, called Smeur ſand,<note place="margin">Smeur-ſand.</note> which ſhooteth off from Phanu, there you may well goe along by direction of the eye without fayling, and let that be on ſtarborde as you come in.

Againſt Robbeknuyt it is verie farre flat, for fifteene fathome depth is at leaſt two leagues from the land. And about four leagues from the land there lyeth a banck of nine fathome, which reacheth along by the land. And againſt Robbeknuyt there lyeth a ſtone or rock about a league from the land.</p>
                        <p>From Robbeknuyt to Hartſhals<note place="margin">Hartshals.</note> it is ſouthweſt and by weſt four leagues.

                        <p>Hartſhals is a long plaine hill,<note place="margin">To knowe Hartshals.</note> on the eaſt ende going ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhoring downe.

                        <p>From Hartſhals to Schaghen the courſe is eaſtnortheaſt eight leagues. The land eaſt from Hartſhals is altogether downie and hillockie land, you may ſee the high land of Laclowe beyonde it, and you finde along upon theſe Coaſts, no ſuch plaine hilles as Bovenberghen, Holmes, Hartſhals, and Robbeknuyt. A litle waie within the point of Schaghen there ſtandeth a flat church with a flat ſteeple, when this church is ſouthſoutheaſt from you, then there runneth a Sand or Flat off from the land, and there you muſt put ſomewhat off from the land, otherwiſe it is all ſhoring ſtrand betweene Hartſhals and Schaghen; but you may ſound that Sand about at ſixe or ſeven fathome.</p>

When the ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the fire beacon are ſouthweſt and by weſt from you, then they are one againſt the other, and then you are againſt the Sand, as I ſaid before: and when the ſteeple is ſouthweſt, and ſouthweſt &amp; by ſouth from you, then you are without or weſt from the Sand: but when the ſteeple or fire beaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is weſtſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, and weſt and by ſouth from you, then you are within the Sand. This you may by night take by your compas, &amp; marke it ſo, to ſee whether you be within or without the Sand, when the fire lighter maketh a cleare bright fire. You may ſette well on both ſides of the Sand, ſo that you may put off from it at 7 or 8 fathome.</p>
                        <p>Some ſaye that upon neceſſitie a man might goe betweene this Sand and the land at two fathome and an half.</p>

                        <p>Betweene Schaghen and Maſterland or Norwaie it is all ſoft ground, and the nearer to Norwaie the deeper water, but when you come out of the Sond, and are in the chanel, and finde no ground at 18, 20, and 22 fathome, it is a ſigne that you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Schaghen Sand.</p>

Alſo on the other ſide of the ſouth ende there ſhooteth off a ſand, ſo that when the aforeſaid flat church is eaſt, and northeaſt from you, there you cannot ſee the land when you are within a league of it: but you may goe ſo neare to the north ende, that you may lye at anckor under it ſafe againſt a ſouth winde, at 3 4 and 5 fathome. From the north ende alſo there ſhooteth off a ſand to the Trindle, but you may ſound it about at three or four fathome, through betweene Leſou and the Trindle.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Trindle.</note>The Trindle lyeth northeaſt, or ſomewhat northerlyer from the northende of Leſou about two great leagues, &amp; from Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen ſand ſoutheaſt and northweſt eight leagues. It is ſtonie ſand ground, about 4 foot deepe, and about ſixe or ſeven akers of land great, reaching along by the chanel of the Sea: On the north ſide alwaies there lyeth a tonne, whereby men may know it a farre off. You may ſayle well through betweene Leſou and the Trindel, and the nearer to the Trindel the deeper water, and the nearer to Leſou the flatter &amp; ſhallower. Cloſe by the Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it is 5 or 6 fathome deepe.</p>

And come no nearer to Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen by night then 14 or 15 fathome. Now when you wil ſayle from Schaghen to Seebuy, then you goe by the ſmall Helmes,<note place="margin">Small Helmes.</note> lying ſouth and by weſt 4 leagues from Schaghen, and if you will goe into the Belt, then you leave them on ſtarborde, going all ſouth and by weſt to Zeebuy.

                        <p>The Helmes are three Ilands, the ſoutherlyeſt the Iutters call the Dien or the Dee, the middlemoſt Holmes, and the norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt the Graſholme, and by it there lyeth another litle Iland. You may ſayle through betweene the ſoutherlyeſt and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt, but neareſt to the ſoutherlyeſt Iland: there is betweene them four fathome water. The beſt Rode to lye in for litle ſhips behinde the Helmes, is betweene the middlemoſt and the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlyeſt Iland, a litle nearer the ferme land then the Ilands, but for great ſhips the beſt lying is by the Graſholme.</p>
                        <p>Betweene the Holmes and the ferme land in the faire-water, it is at the leaſt three fathome deepe.</p>

                        <p>A league eaſt from Helmes there lyeth a heape of ſtones which you muſt beware of, when you will goe into the Belt.</p>
                        <p>A ſhippe that goeth not deepe may ſayle round about the Helmes, for there at the leaſt it is three fathome water. In the chanel betweene the Helmes, and the north ende of Leſou it is

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Iland of Langheland is about eight leagues long, and reacheth ſouth and north, there eaſt againſt it lyeth the Golverſond, which reacheth in north from Laland, and reacheth all up to Neſtvelt, and Worden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and commeth into the Greenſond, and in that Wolf-chanel or Wolve-gat go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the Eaſt-ſea againe. Before Golverſond there lye three Ilands: the one called Wedero, which lyeth at the point of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and is faſt to it by a Sand, ſo that you may not ſayle through betweene them, there northward you goe into Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſond,<note place="margin">To ſayle into Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſond.</note> leaving it on ſtarborde. The other two lye north from the ſaid Iland of Wedero: the firſt whereof is called Arnis, and the other Ooms. Ooms is a litle plaine Iland, but Arnis is the greateſt, it lyeth neareſt Zeland, and is full of trees. From the Iland Ooms a Sand ſtretcheth off ſouthweſt to ſeaward, which is at leaſt a league long, and at the ende flat, that you may runne over with the lead, and when you will ſayle into Golverſond you muſt let theſe two Ilands lye on baghborde of you. The Iland Laland at the weſt point,<note place="margin">The Sand of Laland.</note> over againſt the ſouth ende of Langheland hath a Sand or Hooke, which reacheth off from Laland half over the Belt: to ſhunne it, you muſt runne along a quarter of a league eaſt from Langheland:<note place="margin">Markes of Lalands Riffe or Sand.</note> or if you leave two third parts of the water on Lalands ſide, and the other third part on Langhelands ſide, then alſo you ſhall not ſayle upon it.

                        <p>From the ſouth ende of Langheland to Femeren the courſe is ſoutheaſt and by eaſt ſeven leagues.</p>
                        <p>Now when you come off from Langheland, and have paſt the Sand or Hooke of Laland, the South coaſt of Laland rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth there eaſt and weſt.

                        <p>You muſt ſayle into the Haven of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berghen<note place="margin">Colber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen.</note> betweene two Heads, cloſe before the towne. Within the River of Colber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen, right over againſt the towne there lyeth a Pit or Well, which yeeldeth ſalt to all the Countreyes there abouts, but they muſt ſeeth it, yet the water of the River is as freſh as milk, for it is an out-water.</p>
                        <p>The Coaſt of Pomerland reacheth from Colberghen to Garſhooft<note place="margin">Garshooft</note> northeaſt and by north about thirteene leagues, but betweene them both there lye two Havens called Coſlyn and Ruwold.</p>
                        <p>The haven of Coſlyn lyeth diſtant from Colberghen north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt four leagues. And from Coſlyn<note place="margin">Coſlyn.</note> to Ruwold the courſe is northnortheaſt five leagues. In Ruwold<note place="margin">Ruwold.</note> Haven, or in the River called Wipper a good ſhippe may well goe in, for there come manie Craers out.

                        <p>From Garſhooft to Reefcole it is all white ſtrand, lying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant eaſt four leagues. Reefcol is a high round Hill, whereby you knowe the land when you goe from Borneholme. From Reefcol to Lyba it is ſeven leagues.</p>
                        <p>Lyba lyeth upon a great River called the Oſſe. From Lyba<note place="margin">Lyba.</note> to Serneviſſe or Serneſſe it is five leagues. Betweene them both there lye the three Wolſackes,<note place="margin">Wolſackes</note> which are three black ſtumpes of trees, by the which this Land is well knowne, and right eaſt from thoſe three hillockes there lyeth a long Hill, which when you come out of the weſt, and are at the weſt ende of it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as if it were divided into three or four hillocks. After that followeth the high land of Righſhooft, which is verie ſhoring on the water ſide. Betweene Righſhooft and Reefcol it is a white ſtrand, and for the moſt part full of trees.</p>
                        <p>Serneſſe or Serneviſſe<note place="margin">Serneviſſe.</note> is a towne lying upon an out-water, which with a River ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth into the Sea, but within it divideth it ſelf into a great water.

Under Wranger there is good Rode, and good anckoring on both ſides, and all over good anckor ground.

                        <p>ABout two leagues north from Wranger lyeth a litle Iland full north: from that Iland toward Highland is the courſe ſomewhat more eaſterly then eaſtnortheaſt three-and-twentie leagues, then you runne full north. Highland<note place="margin">Highland.</note> is about three leagues long, and hardly a league broad: it lyeth in length ſouthſoutheaſt and northnorthweſt: to them that come out of the weſt it ſheweth with three hillocks: on the north and eaſt ſide it is full of trees. On the eaſt ſide a litle about the north point is there a litle Creeke by a boores or husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans houſe, there is faire ground, and good lying againſt weſt windes. A certaine ſpace ſouthward from thence, not farre from the ſhore lyeth a great ſtone above the water: On the north ende, alſo on the weſt ſide to the ſouthweſt point it is wholly faire ground and good lying.</p>
                        <p>From Highland to the Sommers (that is a litle Iland) the courſe is eaſt and by north ſeven leagues. A litle eaſt from the Iland Sommers<note place="margin">So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mers.</note> there lye certaine rockes above the water, but you may ſafely ſayle through betwixt the rockes and the Iland. From Sommers to the Goeſchare, or (which is all one thing) the great Fiſher,<note place="margin">Goeſchare or the great Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher.</note> is the courſe ful northeaſt diſtant ſeven leagues. The great Fiſher is a lowe Iland, conſiſting of ſeven rockes joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, therefore it is alſo called the Seven-rockes, and when you firſt deſcrie it, it appeareth with four hillocks, as if it were four lowe Ilands. From the great Fiſher to the litle Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher<note place="margin">The litle Fisher.</note> is the courſe northeaſt &amp; by eaſt diſtant four ſmall leagues. Round about both the Fiſhers you may ſeeke and finde Rode, for both of them are verie faire, but that on the ſouth ſide of the great Fiſher there lyeth a blinde rocke about a peeces ſhotte from the ſhore, when the water is not wholly calme, but that the weather is ſomething rough, you may eaſily ſee the waves breake thereon. About a peeces ſhotte ſoutheaſt, or ſoutheaſt and by eaſt from the litle Fiſher there lyeth a Rock even above the water, as if it were a Seales head, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon chanel is there betweene both. From the litle Fiſher to Corſſenes is the courſe eaſtnortheaſt, and ſomewhat more eaſterly a league, upon the point of Corſnes<note place="margin">Corſnes.</note> lyeth a ſtone as if it were a Iol, you muſt ſayle about it at four fathome and an half. Weſt from Corſnes lye two Ilands cloſe by the land, but eaſtward from the point you may anckor againſt weſterly windes at five or ſixe fathome. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two leagues croſſe from Corſnes there are manie rockss that lye under the water, ſome at a fathome, ſome at half a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome, ſome more ſome leſſe, you cannot venture out of the chanel but with verie great daunger. It is not poſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the right ſituation of all, the grounds are there ſo uneven and craggie: ſo full of rocks, and craggie ſhallowes, that it is to be wondred at. From Corſnes to the Roohel<note place="margin">Rohel.</note> the courſe is northeaſt and by north about three leagues. You muſt leave the Iland of Rohel on ſtarborde and ſayle cloſe by it, or in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the water: but not cloſe by the north point, which our ſaylers call Iohn Lambertſons point, for there ſhooteth off a ſtonie point, which is ſhoring: notwithſtanding you may ſayle about there ſafely by the plummet at ſeven or eight fathome, but come no nearer. In the right chanel betwixt both it is 14 and 15 fathome deepe. When you come within the Roodehel you may anckor where you pleaſe, and fetch a Pilot from the land, which may bring you to Wyborgh.</p>

                        <p>ANout ſand and Col lye diſtant from each other north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt and ſoutheaſt about eleven leagues, you may eaſely ſee them both upon the hatches of the ſhippe in cleare wether, when you are betweene them: in that chanel it is twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and two-and-twentie fathome deepe.</p>
                        <p>From Anout ſand to Zeeland the courſe is ſouthſoutheaſt twelve or thirteene leagues. Betweene Anout and Zeeland it is fiveteene and ſixteene fathome deepe.</p>
                        <p>Anout ſand is verie ſhoring, and reacheth from Anout about eaſtnortheaſt into the Sea: but when you come out of the weſt you may ſound it at ſeventeene or eighteene fathome, but when you come out of the Sond with a ſharpe winde then you can not ſound it. On the north ſide of Anout you may ancker at tenne or eleven fathome, ſo that then you may ſhunne the Sand to goe to the Sond.</p>
                        <p>Betweene Col and Anout there lyeth a banck which is no deeper then ſeven or eight fathome, ſometimes the ſtreame ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veleth much thereon. There lyeth another banck betweene the banck of Anout and Valkenborch of twelve fathome, which reacheth to Haland, which alſo in ſome places is no deeper then eight fathome a litle ſouth from Anout ſand.</p>
                        <p>Betweene Anout and Waersberghen in the chanel it is two-and twentie fathome deepe, but there alſo there lyeth a banck betweene them both of tenne fathome deepe: when you are forced to lye by a winde betweene Anout and Leſou, and that you finde twentie fathome deepe, then you muſt knowe that you beginne to fall neare to Norwaie ſide: but when you runne weſtward and finde but twelve, thirteene, fourteene and five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene fathome, then you muſt knowe that you are towards the Iutſche or Anout ſide, then you muſt winde againe towards Norwaie: but where the bancks aforeſaid lye is declared before, there you muſt looke to it paſſing to and againe over it, leaſt thereby you ſhould erre and goe out of the waie. If you muſt be forced to laveere betweene Leſou and Anout, or betweene the Sond and Schaghen by night or in miſtie wether, you muſt not ſpare your lead: the chanel for the moſt part is twentie, one-and-twentie, two-and-twentie and three-and-twentie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome deepe. Betweene Anout and Lezou in the right chanel it is five-and-twentie fathome deepe: but right betweene Anout and Lezou it is flatte water, of ſeven or eight fathome. There you may ſayle through betweene them both, till you come to the Belt. Anout on the weſt ſide is verie foule, and full of Dwalegrounds of two or three fathome.</p>
                        <p>From the Sand of Anout to the Trindle it is northweſt tenne or eleven leagues.<note place="margin">Trindle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> The Trindle lyeth northeaſt from the north ende of Lezou three leagues, upon it is about eight foot water, but as ſome ſaye but four foot. It is ſtonie ſand ground, and a Flatte in bigneſſe as much as two Morgens of land,<note place="margin">Lezou.</note> it lyeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended along the chanel, and on the northeaſt ſide there lyeth a tonne upon it. From Lezou there commeth a Flat towards the Trindle, which you may ſound at three or four fathome. When you ſayle through betweene Lezou and the Trindle, then the nearer to the Trindle you have the deeper water, that is 5, 6 &amp; 7 fathome: ſpare not your lead by night about the Trindle, nor come no nearer unto it on the out ſide then 9 or 10 fathome.</p>

                        <p>THrough the Sands and the Sond the ſtreame commonly goeth with the winde, but moſt about the North, when a hard eaſt winde bloweth; and then the ſtreame runneth out north.</p>
                        <p>Betweene Waersberghen and Maſterland in the chanel, the ſtreame alſo goeth moſt with the winde, and it raveleth there ſometimes upon certaine places as if they were Sands: this you may ſee in calme wether, when you let a lead ſinke upon the ground.</p>
                        <p>By Schaghen the ſtreame commonly commeth falling out of the Belt, and falleth to the Northeaſt land, ſpecially when the winde hath for a while blowne out of the eaſt or northeaſt: if you come from Anout, and will ſayle to Schaghen by night with a weſt winde, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of the weſt about Schaghen with a ſoutherly winde you would with thoſe ſtreames ſoone be driven under Norwaie, before you ſhould once thinke or imagine ſo much.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, in this chanel of Valſterboen, and from Steden to the Sond, &amp; forth from the Sond to Schaghen it behooveth a Maſter or Pilot of a ſhippe to be verie circumſpect, and not to be careleſſe or negligent to ſhunne all the daungers of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of foule Sands, Rocks and Shallowes which are therein, and about the ſame: therefore he that will uſe theſe Seas muſt be verie warie, for that one that is well acquainted with them hath ynough to doe to looke to himſelf.</p>

When you are by the point of Laus, then you may eaſily ſee the Iland of Kilduyn and the River of Kola, or the land by it, and betweene Laus and the River of Cola there is alſo a great Creeke, and when you are within the mouth of the River, firſt it reacheth in ſouth and by weſt, and then ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouthweſt to the Iland, which in the Carde of this River is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the Letter <hi>A,</hi> and then ſometimes ſouthweſt and by ſouth by the Iland marked with the letter <hi>B</hi> to the Trane Iland, then ſouthweſt and by weſt, and ſometimes about the point weſt and by ſouth, and then in weſt to Divles point, there over againſt it lyeth the white ſtone, which lyeth on the land, and againſt it is good Rode: from thence againe weſt and by ſouth, weſtſouthweſt, ſouthweſt, and ſouthſouthweſt moſt part to Cola.</p>
                        <p>When you are up within the River,<note place="margin">Rode in the river:</note> and will ancker there, then keepe along by the weſt ſide, and when you are a litle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there you ſhall ſee a litle ſmall Iland, lying cloſe by the land, from thence a litle further forward about the high point there is a bought or Creeke, and in it there is a Sandbay, where you may laye a ſhippe ſafe without ancker or cable, it is a faire Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baye where you goe full in, along by the north ſide it is five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome, and faire ſandie ground, and there you goe in betweene the two points: but there lyeth a black rock in the narrowe waie betweene both the ſides of the land, which you muſt leave on ſtarborde, and within that rock it is drie &amp; two fathome deepe, till you be againſt the ſtrand, there within it is faire greene fields.

                        <p>the River by theſe two Ilands, you come in the middle waie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Iland marked <hi>A,</hi> there alſo is good rode on the weſt ſide, there upon the high ground you ſhall ſee three beacons or maſtes, called the three Kinges, againſt them there is a rode, &amp; when you are a litle paſt the Iland marked with <hi>A,</hi> then you can ſee the river no more open, but it ſeemeth to be cloſe and ſhutte up, for then the Iland marked with <hi>A</hi> commeth under the high land on the eaſt ſide.</p>
                        <p>Under the Iland marked with <hi>B</hi> there is alſo good Rode and faire ſandie ground, it is alſo good Rode under the Traen Iland,<note place="margin">Trane Iland.</note> and that is reckoned for half of the River, to wete, from the Mouth to Cola.</p>
                        <p>When you are a litle paſt the Traen Iland, where the letter <hi>C</hi> ſtandeth, then before you ſee a black bluiſh hill, called the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels hill,<note place="margin">Divels hil.</note> and it ſeemeth from thence forth, as if the River were cloſe and ſhutte up: on the ſtarborde ſide it is beſt ſayling along for there you have good ground moſt part along cloſe by the land, there are manie bougths, hookes, and Creekes, which can not all be deſcribed: on the other ſide men uſe not ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to goe, unleſſe it be by default, and there are as it ſeemeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie bayes and rivers, and alſo ſome by-rivers.

                        <p>If you will ſeeke for rode under Kilduyn,<note place="margin">Kilduyn.</note> when you come out of the north or the weſt, then goe to the weſt ende of Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duyn, through betweene the mayeland and Kilduyn, and when you have ſayled a litle within, then you ſhall ſee a round Iland, and there it beginneth to be narrowe, but you may well laveere through it, then goe forth to the ſoutheaſt ende, and there anc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in the bought under Kilduyn, as neere to the land as you will, there ſtand a companie of Lapland houſes, and there is the principal rode, there you are ſafe againſt all windes: the point ſouth from the rode is lowe land.

                        <p>To ſayle from the eaſt into Kilduyn then goe in weſt, till you come by the aforeſaid lowe point of the Iland, then turne up northward along about the point, &amp; ancker in the bocht afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid before the houſes upon the Rode, at twelve thirteene or fourteene fathome, on the ſouth ſide it is verie deepe, fiftie or ſixtie fathome.</p>

To ſayle into Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kena or the river of Swetenoſe when you come north or weſt, then you muſt ſayle cloſe by the land, to have a ſight of the Iland, and goe through betweene the Mayeland and the Iland, but the beſt chanel to goe into it is through betweene the third and the fourth Iland, which is a deepe wide and broad chanel, and lyeth ſouthweſt, and ſouthweſt and by weſt from the point of Swetenoſe, you runne moſt ſouth into the River, and then you ſee the Iland, which lyeth within the other Ilands, you may ancker there behinde. When you are a litle paſt the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Iland, and come againſt the high point, then you ſayle in in the middle of the water betweene both the lands, and there it is ſhallowe water at five, four, three and two and an half fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome, as it ſtandeth marked in the Carde, but you may goe boldly in through the middle of the chanel, along to the Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land houſes, where the ſalmon fiſhing is, and ancker there in the midſt of the water, but you muſt there looke well about you, for there abouts there lye ſome blinde rockes,<note place="margin">Blinde Rockes.</note> which are bare at lowe water.</p>
                        <p>To finde the right ſituation of this haven, then marke, that when the high point is behinde the fourth Iland, about ſouth from you, and the point of Swetenoſe northeaſt and northeaſt and by eaſt, then you are right open before or againſt the ſaid haven. Some ſaye that you may ſayle through behinde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the fourth Iland and the point, but there betweene them both it is verie narrowe.

Having brought the Cape ſo as I ſaid, then ſayle in upon it ſouth and ſouth and by weſt, and ſometimes ſomewhat eaſterlyer. You may alſo place the Cape and the ſteeple right againſt each other, and goe in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,<note place="margin">Depth in the chanel.</note> then you goe in along by the weſt ſide, which farre off from the land is altogether flatte.

But when you can not ſee the Cape, or that it is gone, then you may bring the towne of S. Nicolas into the wood, in ſuch manner, as that almoſt the third part of the wood be weſtward, and almoſt the other two third partes of the wood ſtand eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it. When you have gotten to the mouth of the River, you muſt ſometimes goe eaſterlyer, as, ſouth and ſouth and by eaſt, till you come to the weſt ſide, then goe cloſe along by it, and put not off from it, untill you come againſt the white pleck or place on the weſt ſide, to the place, the which is marked in the Carde with the letter <hi>A.</hi> Then ſtrike over from it eaſt and by ſouth, and eaſtſoutheaſt right to the point of the wood on the eaſt ſide, and ſo ſoutheaſt along by the eaſt ſide, cloſe by the land: but againſt the two Ilands which lye on ſtarborde, it is verie foule and ſhallowe along by the eaſt ſide, which you muſt look to: but goe along by the eaſt ſide, untill you come to the firſt river on baghborde, then ſtrike over againe to the weſt ſide ſouthſouthweſt to the bought, there on the eaſt ſide it is flatte water: and when you are in the bought, then goe on eaſtſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, and then eaſt and by ſouth to the Stone-reach,<note place="margin">Stone-reach.</note> there ſayle in the middle of the river, along by the tonnes, for they lye in the middle of the chanel, and on both the ſides of the tonnes it is uneven &amp; rugged ground. When you come againſt the Stone-reach there ſtandeth a fiſhers houſe upon the weſt ſide, by the litle river that runneth into the land, on the north ende or weſt ende of the Stone reach: againſt that foreſaid houſe there lyeth a great ſtone under the water, about which you may ſayle on both ſides, it lyeth about the middle in the chanel, as you ſayle forward, but Mariners are accuſtomed to ſayle weſtward about, along by the weſt ſide, as alſo through the Stone-reach, for the weſt ſide is deepe ynough, and in ſome places ſoft yeelding ground, but the eaſt ſide is full of ſtones. When you are paſt the tonnes, then you muſt againe keepe ſome thing off from the ſhore. There was wonte to lye an Iland at the ende of the Stone reach, but not long ſince it is wholly cutte and broken awaie by the yce. When you are through the Stone-reach, then the courſe is firſt ſoutheaſt, and then ſoutheaſt and by ſouth into the bought, then goe eaſtſoutheaſt, and keepe along by the weſt ſide, till you ſee the towne of Archangel,<note place="margin">Archangel</note> then ſayle right to it, but ſhunne the point on baghborde for that is foule.</p>

On the ſoutheaſt ende of this Iland there lyeth a high rock called the Monick<note place="margin">Monick.</note> or Somby,<note place="margin">Somby.</note> after the name of the firſt or ſoutherlyeſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Suydro. Betweene the Monick and the ſoutheaſt ende of Zuydro there is a Ras or Well, which you muſt ſhunne, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at a Spring tyde.</p>
                        <p>Upon the weſt ſide of this Iland of Suydro there are no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens for ſhippes to lye at Rode in, for it is altogether high ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring land, but on the north ſide there are manie havens, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into you may ſayle and laye ſhippes at ancker, as Somſond or Heſt, Hofwick, Vroby, Quaelby or Rane, which are all wide ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or havens. A husbandman or Pilot will bring you into them all, whenſoever you will or neede.</p>
                        <p>From the northweſt ende of Suydro to Moggheneſholme,<note place="margin">Mogghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesholme.</note> the weſterlyeſt or uttermoſt Iland of Fero, the courſe is north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt and by north and northnorthweſt about eight or nine leagues.</p>

In the middle of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or haven of Waghe, there goeth a faire haven eaſtward, up into the great Iland of Stromo, therein you may ancker at te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne or twelve fathome, but the haven is at leaſt twentie fathome deepe.</p>
                        <p>Mogghenes and the northeaſt ende of Fero lye diſtant eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>northeaſt, or a litle northerlyer, and weſtſouthweſt about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene leagues.

                        <p>From the ſoutheaſt ende of Suydro to Schalhooft, or the ſoutheaſt ende of the Iland Sando, the courſe is north and by weſt about five leagues. Betweene Suydro and Sando there lye the Ilands of Luttledymen, Stoerdymen, Schavo and Dalſfles.</p>

                        <p>The ſoutherlyeſt lye by three Ilands, but the northerlyeſt lye by eight ſmall Ilands or rockes.

South from Tinmouth there lyeth an out-point called Sonderla:<note place="margin">Sonderla.</note> betweene this point and Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth the River of Newcaſtle runneth in, wherein there is twelve foot water at half flood. From the point of Tinmouth there ſhooteth off a ſtonie banck, which you muſt ſayle in by, but the ſoutheaſt ende is flatte, there you may goe in with the lead at tenne foot half flood. The markes to ſayle into this River are theſe: there are two fire towres which ſtand on the north ſide of the haven, you muſt ſet them one over againſt the other, and ſayle in upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, along by the ſaid ſtonie banck, until you are in, and when you are within, firſt you muſt ſayle all along by the north ſide till you are paſt the towne of Tinmouth, then you muſt turne over to the other ſide, and ſo you come into a crooked waie which ſtriketh up northward, &amp; having paſt that you muſt goe ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Haeſoort, and ſo forward about Haeſoort to the towne of Newcaſtle.</p>
                        <p>From Tinmouth to the Teeſe or Hartlepoole<note place="margin">Hartle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool.</note> the courſe is ſouthſoutheaſt eight or nine leagues.

In the innermoſt part of this haven, that is before the towne of Stockton, it is but four fathome deepe. Right eaſt or ſouth from the Teeſe there lye two chalck hilles, called Humplefoot<note place="margin">Humple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot.</note> and Read hil.<note place="margin">Reddehil.</note>

To ſayle into the River of Humber when you come out of the ſouth, ſet Poltoren right upon the north point of the River, and ſayle up upon it, ſo long untill the ſteeple ſouth from Doepenton commeth betweene the trees and the other ſteeple, then ſayle in weſtſouthweſt and weſt and by ſouth to the firſt middle flatte, then ſayle north or ſouth about till you be before Grimsby, there is the rode at ſixe or ſeven fathome, and there you lye behinde a Middle-flat: from thence further inward the courſe is weſt and by north, and weſt northweſt to the ende of the banck, which reacheth along the haven on the north ſide: when you are at the ende thereof, then you muſt turne up northward in the river of Hul, there within it is ſixe, ſeven, eight and nine fathome as you lye, and there it floweth three fathome up and downe, with dead ſtreame. An eaſt and weſt moone maketh a high water there.</p>
                        <p>If you will goe into Boſton river<note place="margin">Boſton ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</note> you muſt goe along by the land of Slegneſſe, and ſayle cloſe in by the foot ſtrand, and ſo you ſhall not ſayle by Elleknock. When the three trees ſtand ſouth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Somkil or the ſpeere ſteeple, then Elleknok lyeth right to ſeaward from you, then you may ſayle forward along by the land of Leeck, at three or four fathome, to the river of Boſton.</p>
                        <p>You may alſo come againe into the Sea betweene Elleknock and Long ſand,<note place="margin">Long ſand.</note> at three fathome. Betweene the chanel of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton and the chanel of Lin it is all full of Sands and ſhallowes, ſo that it is verie needfull there to take a Pilot for him that will ſayle there, it floweth there three fathome up and downe, ſo that with ſhippes that drawe not much water you may goe over the ſands at high water. An eaſt and weſt moone maketh there a full Sea betweene the Sands.</p>
                        <p>From Flamborowe head to Chappel or the Sonck it is ſouth and by eaſt nineteene or twentie leagues. The Sonck is a Sand which at lowe water is ſeene: weſt from it the eaſt chanel of Lin goeth in.</p>
                        <p>To ſayle into the haven of Lin<note place="margin">Lin.</note> ſayle weſtward about the Sonck, &amp; place the heap of trees over againſt the point of Sitſem or Suytſom, and Chappel eaſt from you, and then goe in ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt and by ſouth, then you ſhall finde the firſt tonne, then ſouth and by weſt and ſouthſouthweſt, and ſometimes ſomewhat we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterlyer till you be about the point, the tonnes and the beacons will ſhewe you the waie: when you are about the point, then you may runne through the ſands into the north chanel, and ſayle through it into the Sea againe, by the tonnes and markes thereof. This north chanel reacheth northeaſt and northeaſt &amp; by eaſt, it is verie well marked and beaconed.</p>

From Chappel to Burnham the courſe is eaſt ſoutheaſt three leagues. If you will put into Burnham you muſt goe in at a high water, you muſt place the ſteeple againſt the black, &amp; ſo ſayle in by the beacons, leaving them on baghborde.</p>
                        <p>Betweene Burnham and Welles there lyeth a banke which you may ancker behinde at five or ſixe fathome, but upon the banke it is but two fathome deepe at half flood.</p>
                        <p>Five leagues eaſt from Burnham lyeth Wells: betwene Wells &amp; Blakny there lyeth a Sand called the Pol &amp; the Peper,<note place="margin">Pol or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> it lyeth faſt to the land, and there it is ſhallowe or flatte far into the Sea, which you muſt ſhu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. On the weſt ſide of this Sand the haven Welles<note place="margin">Welles.</note> goeth in, and the beacons ſtand all along by the Peper, when Hobrom ſtandeth ſouthſoutheaſt from you, then you are weſt from the Peper, and there is good rode (as I ſaid before) at ſixe fathome. Then Welles lyeth ſoutheaſt from you, and then the trees ſtand againſt the ſteeple, you may then ſayle openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the haven of Welles, along by the beacons.</p>
                        <p>Blackney<note place="margin">Blackney.</note> is a Tyde haven going in on the eaſt ende of the Pol: at Blackney there ſtandeth a high ſteeple, which may be ſeene a great waie into the Countrey, when that high ſteeple is againſt the ſmall ſteeple, then you ſee the firſt tonne, lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eaſt or ſouth ende of the Pol, then goe from tonne to tonne till you are within the haven.</p>
                        <p>From Blackney to Cromere<note place="margin">Cromere.</note> the courſe is eaſtſoutheaſt four leagues, and from thence the land reacheth ſoutheaſt and by eaſt to Haesbergherneſſe four leagues. Right ſouth from the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals houſe lyeth Haeſſant or the banck of the Admirals houſe, you may ſayle through betweene this Banck or Sand and the land at two fathome. But without it is eight or nine fathome deepe: when Winterthon<note place="margin">Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon.</note> lyeth weſt from you, then you are ſouth from this banck. A litle to ſeaward from this banck lyeth Winterthon Sand: when Winterthon lyeth ſouthweſt from you, then you are at the north ende of Winterthon ſand.</p>
                        <p>About northnorthweſt and north and by weſt from Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon ſand lyeth the banck before Cromere,<note place="margin">Banck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere.</note> which lyeth at leaſt five leagues from the coaſt of England. When you come out of the north, you may goe through betweene Winterthon ſand &amp; the Banck of the Admirals houſe at tenne or twelve fathome within the bankes, till you come to Yarmouth. But betweene Kockling &amp; the land it is but four or five fathome deepe. Kock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a Banck lying againſt Keſon: when Keſon is againſt the bunch of trees which ſtand there, &amp; upon the flat ſteeple which ſtandeth upon the water ſide, then you are ſouth from Kock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                        <p>Againſt Kockling there is a chanel in the Sea along through the Holmes: if you will goe through it out into the Sea, then ſet Keſon againſt the wood, and then ſayle out of that chanel, you ſhall there have five or ſixe fathome deepe, but on the ſouth ſide it is the deepeſt water.</p>
                        <p>When the ſpeere ſteeple of Winterthon is north from the ſmall ſteeple, then you may alſo goe through betweene Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon banck, and the Holmes into the Sea, and there you ſhall have tenne or twelve fathome deepe.</p>
                        <p>Theſe ſtreames aforeſaid are the principall places, where the greateſt number and beſt herrings are taken, which men keepe all the yeere and ſend into other Countreys.</p>

From the beacon upon the Shooe to Whitakers beacon the courſe is northeaſt, and northeaſt and by north, when you are ſomewhat paſt it, holding the ſame courſe, there you ſhall finde a tonne, which comming to, you ſhall ſee a ſpeere ſteeple ſtanding on the land, and a white or redde houſe upon the ſide of the land, place that houſe and the ſteeple one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, and ſayle north and by weſt upon them, then you ſhall goe over a Sand of three fathome deepe at half flood, which Sand is called the Spits: when you are over that Sand, &amp; have ſixe or ſeven fathome deepe againe, then goe northeaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the point of the Naſe, till you come to it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leave Goen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vliet on ſtarborde.

                        <p>When you come off from the beacon of the Shooe and are paſt Whitakers beacon, and come neere unto the tonne, then there runneth a chanel eaſtnortheaſt into the Sea, of five, ſixe or ſeven fathome deepe: this chanel is called the Kings or Queenes chanel.<note place="margin">The Kings chanel.</note> There lyeth a Sand on the ſouth ſide called the Muys,<note place="margin">The Muys</note> the foot whereof reacheth far into the north. They that ſhould deſire to ſayle out at this chanel, comming eaſtnortheaſt from Whitakers beacon, ſhould eaſily miſcarie behinde a point or foot of Sand, which reacheth about half waie out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Muys. On the north ſide of the chanel lyeth Goenvliet, which at lowe water or half flood is drie.
